<h1 class="unnumbered" id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>Bureaucracy is a consistent and pervasive challenge in our modern
society. Even if you don't consider yourself a bureaucrat, you likely
have direct experience with bureaucracy and are familiar with complaints
about bureaucracy. Why does bureaucracy persist if the concept is
commonly understood to be negative?</p>
<p>Reasoning about bureaucracy is an accessible topic because you have
personal experiences. A commonly held view is that bureaucracies are
broken: participants are harmed and there is inequality. A
counterargument is that the bureaucratic behavior observed is how the
system was designed to work. There is a third argument: bureaucratic
systems work in a degraded mode -- they are less efficient than what is
possible. In this book I set aside the macro-scale questions of
bureaucracy like the three arguments above and focus on the human-scale
interactions that give rise to bureaucracy. Rather than complain about
systemic problems, this book provides you with practical actions for
situations you encounter.</p>
<p>The widely-held negative connotation of bureaucracy may lead you to
reject the label of bureaucrat for roles you are in. Your recognition of
your status as a bureaucrat matters even if you intentionally reject the
label or do not recognize that you are a bureaucrat. How you behave and
what you think your responsibilities are depend on how you label
yourself. If you don't think of yourself as a bureaucrat, then you won't
be able to distinguish what is your fault, what is the fault of your
coworkers, what is the fault of management, and what is intrinsic to
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>This book is for you if you are curious about the complex world we
live in, if you are thinking about how to contribute to society, if you
want your employment to have impact, or if your job is different from
what you expected. This book will help you understand why and how
innovation is often suffocated by bureaucratic organizations.
Understanding the challenges means you can enact ideas that are more
likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Every person in society is a participant in bureaucracy. The purpose
of this book is to decrease the surprise of that experience and better
prepare you emotionally and intellectually for the toil of being a
bureaucrat. You can improve your skills as a bureaucrat with focused
reflection and a helpful guide like this book.</p>
<p>The ideas in this book are intended to alter your view of
bureaucracy. This book starts with an unconventional definition and then
uses the definition to explain the necessity of various aspects of
bureaucracy. Having identified specific challenges, the book serves as a
guide for how you can be effective.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="defining-bureaucracy">Defining
Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Having a precise definition of bureaucracy enables a more nuanced
discussion. The clarity of your thinking enables your effectiveness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Bureaucracy is the process of enacting
policies through subjective decisions, typically in the context of
managing access to a shared resource. Three roles are required:
policymaker, bureaucrat, and subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concepts and techniques in this book are derived from this
definition. For example, in an organization comprised of bureaucrats
typically no person knows everything and no person decides everything,
so bureaucracy relies on distributed knowledge and distributed
decision-making amongst people with distinct roles.</p>
<p>Conventional definitions <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> equate government to
bureaucracy, but by the definition in this book bureaucracy is not
limited to governments. Instead, government is an instance of where
bureaucracy occurs. Therefore this book uses the word "organization" to
encompass governments, corporations, non-profits, or any collection of
people managing access to shared resources. As a consequence, many
people are bureaucrats. For more exploration of this definition, see the
section "<a href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">What is Bureaucracy?</a>"</p>
<p>The framing of how you think about bureaucracy shapes what action you
feel is relevant for changing your environment. Suppose your assumptions
are wrong about how the system of bureaucracy works. Then you will be
trying to change the system to meet your incorrect expectations and your
actions are likely to be wasted effort tackling irrelevant aspects. An
accurate understanding of bureaucracy allows you to be more effective
and your changes to the system are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>You can learn to skillfully navigate bureaucracy by using the
techniques in this book. Your increased effectiveness enhances the
organization you are a member of. Modern society is an interwoven fabric
of organizations, with bureaucracy being the crucial material. Rather
than ponder societal-scale concerns, this book focuses on the
complicated and typical experience of a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Even people who are smart (e.g., they know history, they have
memorized state capitals, they can do math) can struggle when engaging
with complex, large-scale distributed systems comprised of humans.
Thinking about complex, large-scale systems is not part of the
conventional education curriculum. This book will help you learn about
bureaucracy, increase your ability to identify patterns, and apply
relevant techniques. The pervasiveness of bureaucracy means the
opportunities to apply the skills you learn in this book are many -- at
your job, at the grocery store, in negotiations with your family.</p>
<p>A guide for situations you haven't been in before can decrease your
anxiety by making the unfamiliar less intimidating. A guide labels
patterns and provides context for your observations. Recognizing a
familiar challenge can be preferable to the uncertainty of facing a
novel scenario. An unfamiliar situation means not knowing how to start
and not knowing the potential paths to success. In contrast, a challenge
you understand can feel less burdensome. Even if you have not faced the
particular challenge before, a guide can make that new challenge seem
familiar and manageable. Having a guide doesn't make your life easy --
even a challenge that is understood requires creativity and effort.</p>
<p>Having a guide isn't helpful if you find the topic repulsive.
Negative impressions of bureaucracy are common. The word can evoke
reactions of disgust, primarily driven by how individuals have
experienced bureaucracy. The results of bureaucracy can appear idiotic --
wasting time and resources or causing harm to people. Bureaucracy is
even regarded by some as dangerous to society.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In
contrast to negative impressions of bureaucracy, I claim bureaucracy is
vital to society.</p>
<p>The difficulties of bureaucracy are central to large societies that
have complicated dependencies on the interactions of many people. From
foundational services like the delivery of water and removal of sewage,
to advanced manufacturing that relies on long supply chains, bureaucracy
is essential. The challenge of bureaucracy affects governments and
companies in different societies of all scales. And bureaucracy is
durable -- it has existed for thousands of years. Because bureaucracy is
pervasive, tackling the topic of bureaucracy is exciting and crucial.
The excitement comes from the opportunities available for the many
potential improvements. Being an effective bureaucrat is important
because bureaucracy can be a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication">force
multiplier</a> beyond what one person could achieve on their own.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is pervasive because there are few alternatives to
bureaucracy for a society constrained by finite resources. Gaining
skills in navigating bureaucracy is helpful both for your happiness and
the improved functioning of society. That may seem abstract and lofty,
but the situation is difficult to escape: you are a member of society
and benefit from participating in society.</p>
<p>The topic of bureaucracy spans academic disciplines, including <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology">psychology</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology">sociology</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_behavior">organizational
dynamics</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration">public
administration</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology">anthropology</a>,
economics, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science">political
science</a>. Most bureaucrats have no formal training in any of these
domains. This book is not written from an academic perspective; it is
written by a practicing bureaucrat to serve as a guide to be read by
bureaucrats.</p>
<p>As a result of reading this book, you will be better able to
recognize and navigate complex human interactions within your career and
outside of your professional roles. Perspectives offered in this book
can benefit you directly, whether by promotion in rank or title,
increase in pay, successful completion of a project, or through
decreased stress derived from an improved understanding of bureaucracy.
Being a more effective bureaucrat can also positively affect the causes
you care about and the people you engage with.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="what-this-book-is-not">What this Book is
Not</h3>
<p>This book is not a defense of bureaucracy, nor is it intended to
disparage bureaucrats or the system of bureaucracy. Instead, this book
is a guide to bureaucracy-as-it-is. There are no hacks presented for
circumventing bureaucracy. Instead, this book provides advice on being
an effective member of a bureaucratic organization.</p>
<p>Nothing in this book is domain-specific, nothing is tied to the
engineering of products, and nothing applies solely to science research
or policy development. However, skills associated with being an
effective bureaucrat do translate into other domains.</p>
<p>This book doesn't focus on political policymakers, government
oversight (e.g., Congress at the state or federal level, Inspectors
General), competing organizations, contracts, the budget of an
organization, fines and other regulatory punishments resulting from
bureaucracy, policy enforcement, specific policies and regulations,
formal arbitration or judicial resolution of disputes. See Wilson's
<em>Bureaucracy</em>&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1991_Wilson">(Wilson 1991)</span> for observations on those
topics.</p>
<p>This book does not focus on leadership, managing a team, being a team
member, planning, time management, project management, advancing your
career, how to get promoted, or self-improvement. In the process of
being a better bureaucrat, some lessons may apply in those areas.</p>
<p>This book does not discuss work conditions, pay, benefits, or
retirement plans. If you are seeking a competitive advantage that might
result in improved outcomes, learning to navigate bureaucracy helps.</p>
<p>This book doesn't discuss discrimination or harassment. Differences
in experience based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status are
neglected. This book doesn't discuss bad coworkers, abusive bosses,
psychological defects of individuals, or malicious intent. I assume no
traitors, spies, or saboteurs&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1944_War_Dept">(Unit 1944)</span>. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">Dark patterns</a> like
lying, bribery&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2021_Ang">(Ang
2021)</span>, and criminal behavior are not discussed. Those aspects
happen whenever people interact, so the challenges of intentional
defectors are not unique to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>In practice, people are imperfect in their communication and actions.
Sometimes people have less than virtuous motives. The perspective taken
in this book may seem na&#xEF;ve compared to reality. However, addressing the
inadequacies of people you engage isn't specific to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The morals of bureaucrats&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2009_Jackall">(Jackall 2009)</span> and their norms (the
expectations for individuals and organizations) shift over time, while
bureaucracy is persistent. In this book I focus on culturally invariant
aspects of bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>
<p>As a way of limiting the complexity of this book, I assume you are
honest and that other people are honest. I assume bureaucrats strive for
fairness, though the definition of fairness may vary from bureaucrat to
bureaucrat. The complexities of bureaucracy arise even with these
simplifying assumptions and setting aside the topics listed in the
previous section.</p>
<p>The approach in this book is to view bureaucracy from a few
perspectives. The first is a conceptual view focused on the <a
href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">definition of bureaucracy</a> in terms of
managing shared resources. The second view is structural (e.g.,
hierarchy, meetings). The <a href="#sec:fundamentals-of-b">essentials of
bureaucracy</a> will be familiar to experienced bureaucrats. The third
view is based on the experience of a practicing bureaucrat -- <a
href="#sec:effective-bureaucrat">tips on how to be effective</a>, <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a>, and <a
href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">unavoidable hazards</a>.</p>

<p>This book is based on personal experience operating in multiple large
organizations and small teams, reading published books and papers, and
insight from fellow bureaucrats. Informal surveys were conducted but are
not foundational for claims made in this book. No <a

<p>I have tried to learn from my mistakes by reflecting on my
(in)actions and the consequences. This haphazard approach has been an
expensive education. My mistakes delayed progress and damaged
relationships. This book provides generalizations from my experiences
that might benefit you. My hope for this guide is to decrease your
surprise when you encounter what would have been novel situations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>The motivating logic for this book is a sequence of claims:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A community has limited resources that members desire. The
members of the community respond to that constraint by sharing
resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Contention amongst community members regarding access to a <span
data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span> leads to a
need to manage access. Managing access requires making and enforcing
policies that apply to community members. This may start as a consensus
but often a single person is nominated because the cost of consensus is
high. This is not yet bureaucracy because subjects can negotiate with
the person managing access to the resource.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to increased size or complexity, more than one person may be
responsible for making and enforcing policies. Having multiple
policymakers leads to inconsistent policies, so instead the workload is
split into the roles of policymaker and policy execution by a
bureaucrat.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucracy exists when people involved in managing access to
shared resources have the roles of policymaker, bureaucrat, and
subject.</p></li>
<li><p>Managing access to shared resources can involve multiple
bureaucrats operating together. In a large organization the use of
distributed knowledge and distributed decision-making results in <span
data-acronym-label="decentralized bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">decentralized
bureaucracy</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether you're a <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> or a subject of
bureaucracy, you can be more effective by applying <a
href="#sec:process-empathy">process empathy</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've familiarized yourself with the concepts in this book,
using what you've learned is a two-step process. First, ask yourself
whether the conditions for bureaucracy are present. If they are, then
you can be more effective by applying process empathy.</p>
<p>The definition of bureaucracy is the basis for evaluating the
scenario you are in. You may already have a sense of what bureaucracy
is, but a description is provided in the section&nbsp;<a
href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">"What is Bureaucracy?"</a> To supplement
the definition, illustrations of bureaucracy provided throughout this
book show how you can grow your process empathy -- the focus of the next
section.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="process-empathy"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Process Empathy<span
id="sec:process-empathy" label="sec:process-empathy"></span></h2>
<p><em>Process empathy is the central idea of this book. The concept
extends from conventional understandings of empathy.</em></p>
<p>Empathy typically refers to understanding the emotions of another
person. To detect the emotional state of another person, you rely on
facial expressions (smiles for happiness, frowns for frustration), body
language (arms crossed, turning away), speech (yelling in anger, singing
for joy), and actions (hitting something when angry). You evaluate a
person's emotional state from these signals by recalling instances where
you felt similar emotions. Emotional empathy helps you understand and
relate to the other person.</p>
<p>A distinct form of empathy is the ability to understand the reasoning
another person uses. To distinguish that from emotional empathy, I use a
separate label: <a href="#sec:intellectual-empathy">intellectual
empathy</a>. This is the concept of establishing a common understanding
of an issue (even if you disagree). You can apply intellectual empathy
in both a one-on-one interaction and amongst a team of people.
Intellectual empathy is enacted by thinking about how another person
would assess a situation and how they might respond. Another technique
is to imagine what reasoning they would use when presented with a set of
facts. For example, if you're shopping for food and see carrots are
available, you can try to project how other people you live with would
respond to having carrots in their meals. Would they value the variety
in their diet, or would they wonder why you are punishing them?</p>
<p>A third form of empathy is the focus of this book: the ability to
perceive why individuals working together behave in recurring patterns.
What incentives do people in each role have, what information does each
person have, and how does that manifest as actions by the team or
organization? Applying the paradigm of <span
data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span> helps you
answer questions like "Why is this taking so long?" and "Why is this
action so apparently inefficient?" even when no one participant is lazy
or inept. The answers come from recognizing <a
href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">unavoidable hazards</a> of bureaucracy.
As another example, the question "Why are people inadequately trained
for their role?" is resolved by recognizing the consequence of <a
href="#sec:turnover">turnover</a>. Process empathy relies on your
understanding of bureaucracy to help you distinguish which patterns are
specific to the people involved versus specific to the organization
you're engaging with versus generic to every organization.</p>
<p>Process empathy is distinct from reasoning about a process. Reasoning
assumes a holistic external view (exemplified by Gall in <em>The Systems
Bible</em>,&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2002_Gall">(Gall
2002)</span>), whereas process empathy is about the perspective of
individual people operating within their local context. Reasoning about
teams and the aggregate organization invariably leads to observations of
illogical and absurd outcomes, whereas a view based on process empathy
reveals the causes of apparent paradoxes.</p>
<p>Process empathy involves thinking beyond formal roles and deeper than
the abstractions of team-as-entity and organization-as-entity. Because
process empathy is generic across bureaucracies, the benefit of this
perspective is that you can gain insight about people you don't know
doing work you don't understand. Each application will have nuances
specific to the people involved and the shared resource being managed,
but process empathy provides a useful framework for navigating
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Developing your process empathy involves asking questions about your
situation. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What incentives do process participants face? Consider the (lack
of) <a href="#sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples">feedback
loops</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>What unaligned goals do individual bureaucrats have that cause
friction?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the different paths individual bureaucrats take to work
towards their goals? See the list of <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a> bureaucrats face.</p></li>
<li><p>How can you leverage the interplay between processes and
professional interpersonal relationships? See <a
href="#sec:reputation">reputation management</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than asking, "What benefits the team?" or "What supports the
organization?" the paradigm of process empathy focuses on people and
incentives. For example, to be effective you need to identify rules
(written and unwritten), determine who enforces what, consider the
detection mechanics for rule-breaking, and weigh the consequences of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion">subversion</a> against
the benefits of breaking rules.</p>
<p>Developing process empathy does not mean that you trust the people
involved. Process empathy does not mean trusting processes. Faith in
bureaucracy is certainly misplaced. Understanding bureaucracy better
allows you to actively remedy the inefficiencies and deficiencies. You
need to build an understanding of what the process is for a given policy
managing a <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span>.</p>
<p>The question "When is process empathy applicable?" is answered by
"When bureaucracy is present." A clear understanding of bureaucracy is
necessary for building your process empathy.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="what-is-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> What is Bureaucracy?<span
id="sec:define-bureaucracy" label="sec:define-bureaucracy"></span></h2>
<p>While you may know it when you see or experience bureaucracy,<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> for this book definitions are
helpful. Throughout the book I'll refer back to these definitions as I
explain concepts needed to understand bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy involves the creation and execution of policies for
managing access to shared resources. Creating and carrying out policies
usually involves multiple people, each having a specialized role.
Motivated by scalability (how many widgets), complexity (number of tasks
per widget), or latency (time per widget), members with distinct roles
form a hierarchical organization to facilitate coordination. The
organization has control over the disbursement of resources relevant to
the society the organization works within, or the organization
administers a policy within that society. Resources managed by the
organization are either tangible (e.g., water, air, land) or intangible
(expertise, e.g., food inspection, teaching mathematics, painting cars;
information, e.g., census results).</p>
<p>Enacting bureaucracy relies on a combination of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo">quid pro quo</a>
(carrot) and coercion of subjects (stick). The coercion can be a threat
of physical violence or threat of sanction -- namely removal from the
process. This interpretation applies even within bureaucratic
organizations to the member bureaucrats, where threat of sanction can be
formal (up to removal from the organization) or informal (outcast from
the group of professional bureaucrats).</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is not limited to government. Non-profit organizations,
volunteer groups, commercial companies, and even small teams of people
can invoke bureaucratic tendencies. The existence of bureaucracy is
independent of an organization's purpose and independent of whether
money is involved. Carrying out someone else's subjectively defined
policy will require you to make subjective decisions regarding execution
and enforcement.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="roles-in-bureaucracy">Roles in
Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Distinct roles can be identified within the description of
bureaucracy. Bureaucracy involves a <span
data-acronym-label="policymaker"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">policymaker</span>, a policy enforcer
(the bureaucrat), and the person upon whom policy is inflicted (the
<span data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>). The policy is
typically for a shared or contended resource. In the context of
government, the policy creator can be either a politician or a
bureaucrat. In the context of a family, the primary caretaker usually
sets policies. The assignment of roles to individual people is not fixed
-- the assignment depends on the scenario.</p>
<figure id="fig:family-of-bureaucrats">
<img
src="images/family-father-mother-daughter-28725_1280_pixabay.png" />
<figcaption>This family consists of a policymaker, a bureaucrat who
enforces policies, and the subject of bureaucracy. Which person has
which title depends on the situation. For example, if Mom says no
dessert until after the daughter eats her peas, then Dad helps enforce
that policy. The shared resource being managed is the dessert.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A crucial aspect of bureaucracy is the separation of roles:
policymaker, bureaucrat, and subject have to be separate people. This
separation creates <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest">conflicts of
interest</a> that wouldn't otherwise occur. For example, suppose you
need to design a security policy for a computer, and you then want the
policy reviewed. If those two roles are filled by the same person
there's no conflict of interest. One person creating a policy and a
different person enacting policy is necessary for bureaucracy to arise.
Similarly, the person enacting policy must be separate from the person
upon whom the policy is inflicted; otherwise who could complain?</p>
<p>While three people is the minimum for bureaucracy, bureaucrats often
congregate. An organization comprised of bureaucrats typically has a
leader -- something like a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Because the CEO
doesn't know everything and can't make all the decisions a variety of
management styles exist to spread the responsibility within the
organization and leverage the diffuse expertise. Which management style
is most effective depends on the personalities of people involved.
Regardless of management style the challenges of distributed knowledge
and distributed <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making">decision-making</a>
are present.</p>
<p>The roles of policymaker, bureaucrat, and subject apply within
organizations comprised of bureaucrats. That mapping of labels can
initially be confusing but aligns with the personal experience of
bureaucrats. As an example, a supervisor at a state agency is a
bureaucrat, but he sets policy for you and your team members regarding
interactions with other teams in the state agency. In this scenario
bureaucrats on other teams are the subjects of the policy you're
enforcing.</p>
<p>The main character within a bureaucratic organization is the <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> -- the person who is
a member of an organization and is responsible for subjectively enacting
policy on someone else's behalf. The person that a bureaucrat's
decisions are inflicted on is a <span data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>. Depending on context,
a subject may be a student (when the bureaucrat is a teacher) or a
subject may be a citizen if the bureaucrat is a police officer or
government official. Sometimes a bureaucrat's decisions are inflicted on
other bureaucrats-as-subjects, such as when a Chief of Police creates
guidelines for police in their district, or when a senior diplomat sets
policies for embassy employees.</p>
<p>While the roles of policymaker, bureaucrat, and subject are pervasive
in a variety of contexts, bureaucrats usually avoid using the pejorative
label. Typically formal titles are used that are associated with a
specialization. Titles are more than just labels; titles impersonalize
interactions, displacing the need for interpersonal relationships. This
impersonalization is what enables the value of bureaucracy, while also
causing a negative perception. As a subject engaging with a bureaucratic
organization your relationships are supposed to be irrelevant -- you get
access (or don't) to the shared resource regardless. The rest of this
book uses the label of bureaucrat in a neutral sense even though
socially there is a negative connotation.</p>
<p>A <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> subjectively
interprets policies made by someone else and has discretionary
enforcement. Let's break that previous sentence down piece-by-piece.
First, "subjective interpretation" means a person is deciding how to do
something. Subjectivity arises from different reasons one person might
choose an option over a competing alternative. A <span
data-acronym-label="policy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">policy</span> is a set of actions
regarding a shared resource in a given circumstance. Discretionary
enforcement means the bureaucrat chooses how to apply the policy in
specific circumstances.</p>
<p>Often more than one bureaucrat is inflicting a policy, in which case
there's a need to facilitate coordination of stakeholders by applying
specialized knowledge. Facilitating coordination means getting multiple
people in different roles to accept a decision about the shared
resource. The stakeholders are people who care about the application of
the action in each circumstance.</p>
<p>The summary above is still pretty dense, so the rest of the book is
spent expanding the nuances and implications of this definition.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="consequences-of-the-definition-of-bureaucracy">Consequences of the
Definition of Bureaucracy</h3>
<p><em>Armed with the definitions and roles, let's explore the
consequences of this paradigm.</em></p>
<p>Bureaucracy is neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is not tied to
politics, nor is bureaucracy specific to an institution (e.g.,
corporations, governments, academia). The definition of bureaucracy used
in this book is independent of government. Bureaucracy is not defined to
be efficient, nor does it have to be inefficient. Bureaucracy is not
restricted to paperwork, record keeping, quantification, or gathering
metrics. Nothing in this definition involves paperwork or an office
building. Definitions that limit the concept of bureaucracy to specific
contexts result in a decreased ability to describe complex, large-scale
organizations of humans. If you use a definition of bureaucracy that is
limited to government then you'll be confused by similar behavior
showing up in small groups of volunteers and in commercial
businesses.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is typically not inherently a manifestation of
incompetence, laziness, or mistakes. Even with well-trained bureaucrats
trying to help other people, challenges arise when people interact to
manage access to a shared resource. Sources of friction in a well-run
bureaucracy stem from ambiguity, conflicting incentives, finite
attention, and inadequate resources. Bureaucracy is necessary because
shared resources are scarce. There's not enough to satisfy the needs of
the community, leading to contention. Therefore distributed
decision-making and distributed knowledge are relevant for the
allocation of those resources.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is about delegation of control, communication,
decision-making, coordination, and processes. A vital aspect of
bureaucracy is that decisions are made humans.</p>
<figure id="fig:am-I-a-bureaucrat">
<img src="images/relation_between_shared_resource_and_bureaucarcy.png"
style="width:105.0%" />
<figcaption>This book focuses on bureaucracy but there are ways to
manage access to shared resources that are not bureaucratic. This
decision tree shows ways that are and are not bureaucratic. Start from
the top, then evaluate the sequence of questions to determine which
label applies to your situation. One endpoint on the bottom left
(unregulated pollution) is an instance of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of
the commons</a> -- the case of a shared resource with no constraints on
use. In that situation someone will try to get away with behavior that
is harmful to the community of users.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The consequence of subjectivity is that policies are negotiable.
Bureaucrats rely on negotiation to adjust to nuanced circumstances not
foreseen when policies were designed. You (whether in the role of a
subject or a bureaucrat) need to know who to negotiate with and how to
negotiate the changes you seek.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic decisions are subjective, but there are actual rules
that constrain humans. The mathematical physics that describe nature are
not negotiable. Everything in your environment is either naturally
occurring macroscopic emergent phenomena (e.g., chemistry, biology) or
humans making up labels and norms. Distinguishing the two is critical to
knowing what you can change and what you have to work within. See
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:am-I-a-bureaucrat" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:am-I-a-bureaucrat">1.2</a> for an illustration of
the decision sequence.</p>
<p>The complexity of bureaucracy is due to the lack of standard,
objectively quantifiable feedback mechanism for individual participants
in the organization. This aspect is why governments, schools, and
prisons are characterized as bureaucratic. The military doesn't rank
soldiers by "number of enemies killed" and is bureaucratic. Even
profit-driven commercial organizations are bureaucratic when the actions
of individual employees are not coupled to the metrics of profit.</p>
<p>Profit-based feedback makes some roles in a business context slightly
more predictable and sensible. Even in that situation there are
subjective trade-offs like which costs get externalized and whether to
focus on long-term profit versus short-term profit.</p>
<p>The concept of bureaucracy is most visible for complex recurring
situations involving many people and the control of a shared resource.
The friction of bureaucratic processes can be lower when there are only
a few people involved ("I'm just talking to my collaborator," or "I'm
just buying groceries from a clerk at the store," or "I'm using a
website for a government service"), but there is a gradient to more
obvious instances of bureaucracy. Bureaucratic tendencies are observable
at small scale, but in that limit it becomes difficult to distinguish
what is attributable to the specific participants.</p>
<p>Operating within an organization of bureaucrats feels different from
other parts of your life because of the interdependence and loss of
autonomy. Modern conveniences are designed to hide bureaucracy and
create the illusion of independence. Aspects of modern life like
electricity, water, sewage, safety, and entertainment all operate at a
scale that makes dependence on other humans almost invisible. You
probably don't know the person who wired your house, runs the electrical
power plant, monitors the flow of clean water, or treats sewage. A
breakdown of those services is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">leaky
abstraction</a>: what was hidden becomes visible.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="decentralized-bureaucracy-is-complicated">Decentralized Bureaucracy
is Complicated</h3>
<p>Decentralized bureaucracy is the use of distributed knowledge<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and distributed decision-making.
That is in contrast to easier-to-understand concepts like centralized
knowledge and centralized decision-making. A government run by
dictatorship is easier to conceptualize than democracy because there is
a central character around which a narrative can be formed. Similarly,
stories about the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">CEO</a> of
a company are easier than capturing the thousands of interactions
conducted by the many employees of that company. The vast majority of
the work done in an organization is coordinated and carried out by
people other than the CEO. Most of what is known within an organization
is known by people other than the CEO. Linear storytelling with a small
number of main characters does not map well to the complexities of
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If you think bureaucracy sucks and should be removed or replaced,
consider the parable of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton%23Chesterton%27s_fence">Chesterton's
fence</a>&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1929_Chesterton">(Chesterton 1929)</span>. <span

<blockquote>
<p>"There exists ... a fence or gate erected across a road. The more
modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the
use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type
of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I
certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you
can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you
to destroy it.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to learn the historical evolution of processes that your
organization relies on to understand the bureaucracy local to your
environment.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="the-scope-of-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> The Scope of Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is widespread and therefore worth learning about so you
can be effective. When you recognize bureaucracy specific to your
environment, you will be better able to respond appropriately. If you
recognize the systemic incentives driving a person's behavior, you are
less likely to see the person as malicious or incompetent. You are also
more likely to be able to negotiate with them and enact the changes that
you seek.</p>
<p>The definition of bureaucracy in this book (managing access to shared
resources) is consistent with conventional perceptions of bureaucratic
organizations. That resource can be external to the organization or
internal to the organization. Examples of external shared resources
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency">Environmental
Protection Agency</a> (EPA) manages access to bureaucrats who have
expertise with environmental regulations governing water, air, workplace
safety, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Mail delivery by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service">United
States Postal Service</a> (USPS).</p></li>
<li><p>Public safety for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation">Federal
Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI).</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.intelligence.gov/">United States
Intelligence Community</a> manages access to bureaucrats who have
expertise in collecting foreign intelligence.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats in the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug
Administration</a> (FDA) use their expertise to regulate food safety to
serve their community.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats of the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/">Federal
Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) have expertise on flight safety to
protect their community.</p></li>
<li><p>The information technology department in a large organization
manages staff with expertise in repairing computers.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats in the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug
Administration</a> use their expertise to regulate food safety to serve
their community.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats of the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/">Federal
Aviation Administration</a> have expertise on flight safety to protect
their community.</p></li>
<li><p>The military manages the shared resource of bureaucrats with
expertise in war-making.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also resources internal to an organization like attention,
skill, and expertise. Those shared internal resources get quantified as
time, money, and staffing. While talking about trade-offs of time,
money, and staffing are easy, keep in mind they are proxy measures for
the central intangible resources like attention and expertise. The
bureaucracy of managing access to shared resources is descriptive but
doesn't provide actionable insight to you, whether you are a practicing
bureaucrat or subject. Bureaucracy is not a distant, faceless concept.
Bureaucracy permeates your environment and is the basis for many
interactions you have with other people. Actionable concepts are
highlighted throughout this book in the margins.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="who-is-a-bureaucrat">Who is a
Bureaucrat?</h3>
<p><em>A variety of roles and interactions provide conditions for
inflicting subjective policy regarding shared resources.</em></p>
<p>A cashier in a gas station is a bureaucrat. The shared resource is
the gas and other items for sale. The "policy" might be "take money from
customer in exchange for items sold in the store and gas from the
pumps," but the subjective application of that policy leaves a lot of
room for the cashier to shape the customer's experience. Does the
cashier greet the customer when the customer enters the store? Does the
cashier look at the customer to acknowledge the customer? Smile? How
quickly does the cashier engage the customer? Minor nuances left to the
cashier in the execution of the store policy mean there is room for
subjective application of the policy.</p>
<p>A bank teller, a loan officer, and a bank's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support">technical
support</a> are all bureaucrats. The shared resource includes money the
bank manages and the expertise associated with managing money. Each
employee subjectively enforces policies on behalf of the organization.
Each role has a different amount of influence on the bank's finances. Of
these three roles, the loan officer's interactions with bank customers
provide the most straightforward route for feedback based on profit. The
loan officer doesn't act alone though -- the customer's interactions with
tellers and the bank's technical systems also matter to the customer's
decision about how and where to manage money.</p>
<p>This same discretionary application of policy applies to commercial
bureaucrats like sandwich makers, car salespeople, oil well drillers,
grocery clerks, retail clerks, and plumbers. Public school teachers,
state and federal police, military members, tax collectors, and other
state workers are government bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Factory line workers subjectively apply policies, with the assembly
line and factory being the shared resource. Enforcement of quality
standards is a subjective policy. The pacing of work is a negotiation
with management that directly influences productivity and profits. The
feedback loop for factory workers from profit generated by the product
is typically weak and diffuse.</p>
<p>Structured environments like sports featuring well-defined rules do
not eliminate bureaucracy. Teammates use subjective policies on who to
work with, how to best leverage their strengths, and when to exploit the
opponent's weaknesses. The policies are set in part by the coach.
Referees make subjective determinations about rules.</p>
<p>Sometimes bureaucrats do not work directly with customers, citizens,
or products. Then the bureaucratic process is inflicted on fellow
bureaucrats. In that scenario, a bureaucrat is subjectively applying a
policy to other bureaucrats.</p>

you are not a bureaucrat. <span id="box:self-administered-exam"

</div>
<p>See Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:am-I-a-bureaucrat" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:am-I-a-bureaucrat">1.2</a> for a more detailed
evaluation. &nbsp;<br />
Identifying yourself as a bureaucrat matters because the label informs
the responsibilities of your role. The risk of not self-identifying as a
bureaucrat is that you won't grasp how much control you have in enacting
and enforcing policy. If you think of yourself as having to blindly
follow rules, you will harm the people you are applying the rules to and
the organization you are applying the rules for. The value of having
capacity for judgment is so you can adapt policies to circumstances.
Power is merely decisions that alter the opportunities of other people.
Your perception of what decisions are available determines how much
power you have.</p>
<p>In a similar sense from the consumer's or citizen's perspective, if
you don't think you are interacting with a bureaucracy, you won't
perceive the opportunity to negotiate. If you view rules as unchanging
and inflexible, you will harm your ability to make progress. If a human
made a rule, then that rule is flexible. Who made the rule? Who enforces
the rule? If you can talk to them, could they be convinced to make a
modification or an exception? Sometimes the answer is yes.</p>
<p>If you don't think about the bureaucratic framing, you might think
the store clerk is enforcing a policy because they don't like you.
Assigning personality conflict as the cause might lead to a different
conversation with their manager (the person who created the policy).</p>
<p>If you don't think of yourself as a bureaucrat, you may behave
passively in your job. The paradigm of "just tell me what to do" is the
default (learned in school) and you won't know how to engage with
coworkers and bosses since their role is distinct from that of a friend,
family member, or teacher. You will be less likely to understand how to
leverage members of your organization. Thinking from a bureaucrat's
perspective explains why communicating within your organization is
critical to your success and the organization's success.</p>
<p>If you think of yourself as merely a cog in a machine, you are less
likely to notice that you exert influence in the process and you are
less likely to recognize the autonomy available to you. If you think "I
have a real job (e.g., nurse, cashier, teacher); therefore I'm not a
bureaucrat," you are less likely to recognize the subjective power you
have in interactions with the public. If you think, "I'm at the bottom
of my organization's hierarchy; therefore I do not have power," you are
less likely to notice autonomy when it is available.</p>
<p>If you don't consider yourself to be part of a bureaucratic process,
you'll behave differently in interactions with bureaucrats. You won't
perceive opportunities to negotiate because processes seem fixed instead
of subjective. You won't recognize the motives and incentives of
bureaucrats, so their activities will seem incomprehensible. Once you
identify as a contributor to the bureaucratic process, you will be able
to effectively engage, negotiate, and make meaningful changes
happen.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="factors-influencing-bureaucracy">Factors
Influencing Bureaucracy</h3>
<p><em>The size of an organization and the complexity of managing access
to shared resources drive the challenges of bureaucracy.</em></p>
<p>Although bureaucracy can be present for as few as three people, and
bureaucracy is often apparent in teams (e.g., 3 to 20 people), this book
focuses on the situation of multiple teams comprising an organization.
The size of an organization ranges from tens of people up to millions of
people. Examples of companies that employ more than a million people<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> include Walmart, Amazon, and
McDonald's. Size isn't a requirement for bureaucracy. Small companies
with a few people incur bureaucracy because of the need to coordinate
subjective policies governing access to shared resources.</p>
<p>There are three distinct sizes of bureaucracy.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The smallest instance of bureaucracy is when the minimum of the
three roles (policymaker, bureaucrat, subject) exit. At this size
dysfunction is due to the bureaucrat interpreting policy.</p></li>
<li><p>A medium-sized bureaucracy has more than one bureaucrat
interpreting the same policy. Dysfunction is caused by different
interpretations of the policy having different consequences for
subjects. This results in the feeling of unfairness attributed to
bureaucracy.</p></li>
<li><p>A large bureaucracy is distinguished by different bureaucrats
working in opposition because they are referencing different policies.
The subject of bureaucracy is burdened with resolution but doesn't have
the authority to resolve the dissonance. Processes can appear
nonsensical from the holistic perspective. The label of <span
data-acronym-label="decentralized bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">decentralized bureaucracy</span> is
used in this book to indicate reliance on distributed knowledge and
distributed decision-making. At this size the unaligned incentives for
different bureaucrats create dissonance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of bureaucracy typically scales with the complexity
associated with a shared resource. For example, if participants in a
society only used hand tools they could make themselves, then there is
less need for bureaucracy. Mining and producing small amounts of metal
is feasible for an individual, though the relevance of specialization
becomes clearer. A society large enough to support the technology of
writing (beyond the use of clay tablets) seems to coincide with the
bureaucratic need for writing. Getting to technology like the telegraph
and radio requires a society that supports complex processes and
specialization -- key features of bureaucratic systems. While decreasing
accidental bureaucracy is feasible, there is some essential
bureaucracy<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> necessary for maintaining the
current level of technological sophistication.</p>
<p>In addition to essential task complexity, the size of bureaucracy
depends on accidental factors like how old the bureaucracy is, how big
the community being supported is, and how diverse the community is.</p>
<p>Money is uncorrelated with bureaucracy. Bureaucracy occurs in
commercial companies, government, and non-profit organizations. Money
can help align incentives and provide feedback loops to inform behavior,
but money can also be the source of administrivia and policies.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy emerges in small organizations, has scale-invariant
patterns, and is generic across sectors. The complexity of the tasks may
differ, but the same scale-independent patterns emerge because of a
common factor: human behavior.</p>
<p>The scale-independent patterns and underlying human behavior are the
focus of the next section. The Fundamentals of Bureaucracy maps the
formal definition of bureaucracy used in this book to commonly observed
features of bureaucracy: decision-making, hierarchy, communication, and
feedback loops. Understanding these fundamental aspects helps develop
your process empathy by knowing why these features exist.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.4" id="fundamentals-of-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Fundamentals of
Bureaucracy<span id="sec:fundamentals-of-b"
label="sec:fundamentals-of-b"></span></h2>
<p>There are four essential elements of bureaucracy: a shared resource
and three roles (policymaker, bureaucrat, subject) inhabited by
different people. These elements give rise to observable features that
are commonly cited as being bureaucratic, but these aspects are referred
to here as Fundamentals of Bureaucracy. This section outlines the
critical roles of decision-making, hierarchy, communication in
bureaucracy, and feedback loops. The list presented here is smaller than
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy%23Max_Weber">Max
Weber</a>'s&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2015_Weber">(Weber
2015)</span>.</p>
<p><a href="#sec:decision-making">Decision-making</a> is central to
bureaucracy. Every other aspect of bureaucracy derives from
decision-making. The decision-making in bureaucracy is for the
management of access to shared resources. In the definition of
bureaucracy used in this book, "shared resources" refers to information,
expertise, and tangible goods.</p>
<p>When there are multiple people present coordination of
decision-making is crucial to the management of shared resources. Who
gets to make which decision is managed using a <a
href="#sec:hierarchy-of-roles">hierarchy</a> of roles? While
coordination can occur without hierarchy when there are a small number
of people, typically an organization of people leads to both formal and
informal hierarchies.</p>
<p><a href="#sec:meetings-for-coordination">Meetings</a> and <a
href="#sec:written-communication">written communication</a> help with
consensus among bureaucrats, though agreement isn't necessarily the
outcome. Once a decision is made, the choice selected by a bureaucrat
propagates throughout the organization to achieve some level of
consistency.</p>
<p>A less prominent feature of bureaucracy is the weak <span
data-acronym-label="feedback loop"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">feedback loop</span>. This
distinguishes bureaucracy from a market-based system where the
consequences of decisions manifest as profits and losses. If you sell
shoes, you can evaluate decisions you've made by measuring how much
money you make. In contrast, the decisions of a bureaucrat are often
barely felt by the bureaucrat. That weak feedback loop (few consequences
for the decision-maker) means learning from mistakes is harder and
positive reinforcement for good outcomes is negligible. A weak feedback
loop does not mean there are no consequences. The actions of a
bureaucrat create ripples that other people feel. This is described in
more detail in the section on <a
href="#sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples">feedback loops and
ripples</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not an academic researcher of bureaucracy, you might not
want to think about hierarchy, collaboration, or coordination. Meetings
and email are not your goal; you just want to do the tasks you are
trained for. This attitude is consistent with your experience in school
where you progressed by being graded as an individual student. Now that
you are employed your job has pay, promotion, hiring/firing, and a
title. School, and now employment, may seem focused on your abilities
(instead of on the class you're in or the team you're a member of).
While this attitude is common, it is not effective.</p>
<p>The following sections explain why the individualist mentality is
ineffective when you are part of a system of distributed knowledge and
distributed decision-making.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="fundamental-decision-making-in-a-bureaucracy">Fundamental:
Decision-making in a Bureaucracy<span id="sec:decision-making"
label="sec:decision-making"></span></h3>
<p>Decisions are central to a bureaucratic organization. This book
explores the topic of decisions, but decisions are not the only source
of change in an organization. Occasionally events unfold without
decisions being made either because the decision-makers are not informed
or there is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willful_blindness">intentional
neglect</a>. This book focuses on situations where bureaucrats recognize
the need for a decision and want to make the best decision.</p>
<p>There are multiple types of decisions. A <span
data-acronym-label="simple decision"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">simple decision</span> has one
correct or beneficial choice and one or more wrong or harmful choices.
The work of decision-making is then to gather information that
identifies the correct or beneficial choice and select that option.</p>
<p>The best case scenario for any decision-making is one person making a
well-informed, simple decision that has immediate consequence and the
consequence is to the decision-maker. Examples from elementary school
include arithmetic math problems, multiple-choice quizzes, spelling
tests, and memorization tests. A bureaucrat's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_injury">moral injury</a>
(feelings of guilt, inadequacy, frustration) comes from decision-making
that involves multiple people, weak feedback loops with high latency,
and complex decisions with multiple objectives. This last feature is the
focus of the next section.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="example-decision-method-pareto-frontier">Example Decision Method:
Pareto Frontier<span id="sec:pareto" label="sec:pareto"></span></h4>
<p>A complex decision may have many choices, and there may not be a best
option. As examples from your life where there isn't a right outcome,
consider questions like the following. Which car should I buy? What food
should I eat? Where should I live? What job should I have? For the
complexity of these questions there are techniques for navigating the
process to arrive at a result. One approach for describing the situation
is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front">Pareto
frontier</a>. The purpose of describing this technique is to illustrate
the shortcomings of quantitative modeling.</p>
<p>The concept of a Pareto frontier is relevant when there are multiple
possible solutions, no one of which is best. The set of adequate and not
equivalent solutions is called the frontier. Some solutions are
inadequate and are not part of the frontier. If multiple solutions on a
Pareto frontier exist then you can evaluate trade-offs.</p>
<p>As an example of a complex decision made by one person with immediate
consequence and direct relevance to the decision-maker, suppose you want
to buy a car. You care about primarily about two aspects: fuel
efficiency and cost. See Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:pareto_frontier_cars"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:pareto_frontier_cars">1.3</a> for an example of the
Pareto frontier.</p>
<figure id="fig:pareto_frontier_cars">
<img src="images/pareto_frontier_car_options.png"
style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption>Four cars: L, M, N, and P. The buyer's goal is to spend less
money (lower on the vertical axis) and get better fuel efficiency (right
on the horizontal axis). Choices not on the frontier should be avoided,
but that doesn't yield a single result.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Visualizing a Pareto frontier for two quantitative variables is easy,
but typically decisions involve more factors. For example, evaluating
the trade-off of three quantitative variables like passenger capacity,
cost, and fuel efficiency creates a surface. With more than three
variables visualization is less useful, though the analysis technique
still applies.</p>
<p>Another constraint on using Pareto frontier analysis is that it works
well when there are many options relative to the number of variables you
are optimizing for. The assessment does not work well when there are few
choices relative to the number of variables. For example, suppose there
are five choices of car and you want high fuel efficiency, enough cargo
capacity, maximum number of passengers, stylish, low cost, low
maintenance, good durability, and high resale value. Then defining a
Pareto frontier is less effective.</p>
<p>For a set of quantitative variables, a Pareto frontier does not
account for the relative importance of different variables. Assigning
weights to each of these factors merely stretches one axis relative to
the other axes.</p>
<p>There are many possible frameworks besides Pareto frontiers, but in
practice a typical bureaucratic decision is under-informed, has diffuse
consequences, delayed impact, and does not affect the decision-maker. In
bureaucratic processes there is rarely a formal assessment of options.
Decisions are rarely recorded. Even afterward a decision can be
difficult to evaluate for correctness because there are multiple
stakeholders.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: If the people you want to convince are not swayed by
data, then you can augment the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">analysis
of costs and benefits</a> with emotionally-impactful stories.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="risks-of-using-decision-frameworks">Risks of
Using Decision Frameworks</h4>
<p>Frameworks from decisions can be attractive to bureaucrats intending
to formalize <a href="#sec:process">processes</a> and encourage
predictability, but there are potential risks to be aware of. For
example, analysis of costs and benefits can decrease the apparent
responsibility of the decision-maker. Another risk is that cost-benefit
analysis can be used to deflect criticism for an action.</p>
<p>A good approach for data-driven quantitative analysis involves coming
up with a testable hypothesis, pre-registering what actions are to be
taken after assessing the results, then performing experiments and
collecting data to evaluate the hypothesis. A decision can be
characterized as quantitative when based on measurements. For example,
before going into a store I set a threshold: I'm willing to spend up to
$30 on a pair of pants. If no pants that I want are available at or
below that price then I don't buy pants.</p>
<p>More commonly, a decision is made, then data is gathered that
supports the desired outcome. Forming an opinion and then looking for
evidence to back the outcome yields suboptimal results for the
organization but may be motivated by maintenance of the decision-maker's
relationships. The value to the person using that suboptimal approach is
extracted from other members of the organization or subjects of the
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>To distinguish good data-driven decisions from the more common
experiences let's be precise about the other ways decisions get made. A
decision is political when the basis is historical relationships,
maintenance or creation of a relationship, or to enable future
relationships. A decision is subjective when someone else faced with the
same scenario would have come to a different conclusion. To avoid the
appearance of subjective decision-making or political decision-making, a
bureaucrat may frame a decision as "data-driven." To evaluate which
label is relevant, look for measurements and pre-registered actions.</p>
<p>Even when a bureaucrat is not intentionally biased towards an
outcome, there are many ways to gather evidence -- informal conversations
with stakeholders, formal surveys, measuring aspects of the problem. The
choice of information gathering is constrained by cost and time,
producing an incomplete picture of the options. Poor data collection
with biased sampling produces biased results.</p>
<p>Even with valid and representative data measurement, decision-makers
can be led astray by poor modeling. A model may use inapplicable
techniques or may have implementation bugs.</p>
<p>For all the dangers described above, there are worse approaches that
do not rely on measurement. People rely on history (if they are aware of
it) and perpetuate bad ideas, or take action based on what is best for
their career, or decide based on how to accumulate more power, or choose
based on what someone else says to do.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="alternative-approaches">Alternative
Approaches</h4>
<p>Identifying the spectrum of ways bureaucrats make decisions can
decrease the surprise when you encounter the approaches in practice.
Listing the choices of how to make a decision allows for conversation
about the pros and cons of each. The spectrum below is ordered from
least effective to most effective and is not exhaustive.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Random selection from the options (e.g., roll of the dice, shake
the Magic 8 ball shown in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:magic8ball"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:magic8ball">1.4</a>). The
decision-maker is minimizing their involvement.</p></li>
<li><p>Rely on a hunch. The decision-maker is involved with the options
but doesn't rely on data.</p></li>
<li><p>Rely on experience, whether yours or someone else's.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">cost-benefit
model</a> that identifies relevant factors and relates them to determine
possible outcomes, then gather data, and analyze to inform the
decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a hypothesis, design an experiment, carry out a test,
collect data, and analyze.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Brainstorming aspects of bureaucracy like "How do decisions get
made?" improves your emotional resilience when you encounter instances
in your life. Building your Process Empathy involves thinking about how
someone else might accomplish an activity. Consider what are all the
possible ways, rather than merely identifying what is the best way.</p>

id="why-cost-benefit-analysis-models-are-not-used">Why cost-benefit
analysis models are not used</h4>
<p>Applying quantitative models to decision-making may seem to be a
valuable path to optimal outcomes. Improved decision-making that helps
stakeholders seems attractive, but there are various reasons this
approach is not taken. The reasoning is outlined here not out of
cynicism, but so that you can appropriately respond when confronted with
arguments against <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">modeling
costs and benefits</a>. Decreasing your surprise through the inoculation
of exposure enables you to develop counterarguments.</p>
<p>One reason to avoid cost-benefit modeling is that there is a lot of
work to do, so coming up with a model is an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity
cost</a> -- you have less time available to do "real work." Modeling
every decision in detail is unrealistic, so triage is needed -- which
decisions warrant what degree of investment in analysis? Practice
designing models and getting feedback on them is expensive. A person
inexperienced in modeling decisions will take longer and is more likely
to create a bad model. Identifying relevant parameters for inclusion in
a model is a learnable skill.</p>
<p>If a person has a bad experience with cost-benefit modeling, they may
be less likely to try again with other decisions. Bad experiences can
come from using incorrect data, missing a critical variable, picking the
wrong scope for a question, implementing the right model with the wrong
math, misinterpreting the result, using a model that is too in-depth or
not sufficiently deep, or failing to sell the result of an analysis to
stakeholders. There are many sources of risk, and any one is sufficient
to cause failure.</p>
<p>Another challenge for quantitative cost-benefit modeling is the
difficulty of accounting for personalities or organizational politics.
Quantifying idiosyncratic and unpredictable relationships is
impractical.</p>
<p>Another challenge of using models is that the best option identified
by a model may decrease the decision-maker's power or prestige, or harm
relationships. A model result that aligns with the interests of
stakeholders is more likely to be used.</p>
<p>A last reason why cost-benefit models are underutilized is the need
for measurements. Designing good data collection and then collecting
data is costly in terms of time and attention. Because the measurements
involve people the data can get perverted by an undesired feedback loop.
That concept is called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law">Campbell's
law</a>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="decision-making-delay">Decision-Making
Delay<span id="sec:decision-delay"
label="sec:decision-delay"></span></h4>
<p>Decisions are critical to bureaucracy, but that does not mean
decisions are made quickly. From an outsider's view, what appears as
"organizational inertia" is the delay of internal decision-making and
the delay of dissemination. Delay comes from:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time used by each decision-maker to gather information, arrive at
a decision, change processes, share their choice, and justify their
choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Processes designed to detect and counter cheaters and people with
malicious intent, whether that means a malicious bureaucrat or malicious
subject.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">Analysis

Another source of paralysis is a lack of clarity about which framing is
applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>When stakeholders push back, either in disagreement or seeking
clarification.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the source, delays for decisions are frustrating for
both decision-makers and subjects. Your Process Empathy is built on
understanding the reason for why delays are expected.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="a-bureaucratic-decision-involves-many-decisions">A Bureaucratic
Decision involves many Decisions</h4>
<p><em>What may appear a straightforward choice invokes related
opportunities and constraints.</em></p>
<p>A decision regarding shared resources is a collection of
interdependent choices. After recognizing the need for a decision,
follow-on decisions include identifying the stakeholders (who to include
in an analysis) and identifying options. Who is a stakeholder and what
options are available are interrelated. Involving more people expands
the number of options and the complexity of coordination. Other choices
associated with reducing uncertainty are how much time to spend on the
decision, how much information to gather for the decision (see
Dilemma&nbsp;<a href="#table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little">3.18</a>),
whether to make the decision or push the decision to someone with more
expertise (see Dilemma&nbsp;<a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-scope-of-speaking"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-scope-of-speaking">3.40</a>), or
whether to push the decision to someone with more exposure to the
consequences.</p>
<p>Most decisions you make as a bureaucrat do not have hard deadlines.
Instead, there are <a href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">trade-offs</a> in the
allocation of your attention. Sooner is preferable since the consequence
of the decision helps the organization and allows you to focus on other
tasks, but delaying allows you to gather more information for a
better-informed decision; see Dilemma&nbsp;<a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little">3.18</a>.</p>
<p>If a bureaucrat relies on consulting an <a
href="#sec:expertise">expert</a>, the decision-maker needs to be
confident the expert is not straying outside their area of expertise.
For example, don't rely on a botanist to explain how to change the oil
in your car. Besides knowing their limitations, the expert should be
clear about whether their input is a factual summary, a predictive
assessment, or a value judgment. This complicates what you as a
bureaucrat are interested in when deciding what's the best choice.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="transparency-of-decision-making">Transparency
of Decision-Making<span id="sec:transparency-of-decisions"
label="sec:transparency-of-decisions"></span></h4>
<p><em>A decision about decision-making is about what level of
accessibility the decision should have before, during, and after the
decision.</em></p>
<p>Your process might change if made visible to stakeholders. You may
provide more precise justifications or spend more time gathering
evidence to support a claim. Strengthening the arguments is beneficial
but takes time and resources.</p>
<p>Frank conversations and exploratory brainstorming need protections to
allow participants to be vulnerable. This is the motive for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House
Rule</a> -- meeting participants can use information from the discussion,
but revealing who made a comment is not allowed. The concept of
transparency can apply before a decision is issued, while a policy is in
effect, or after the consequence (as part of a review). Making decisions
as part of a transparent process can make participants more risk-averse
because of the potential for failure.</p>
<p>People affected by the decisions benefit from understanding how the
decisions were made -- this is the reasoning behind <a

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="fundamental-hierarchy-of-roles">Fundamental:
Hierarchy of Roles<span id="sec:hierarchy-of-roles"
label="sec:hierarchy-of-roles"></span></h3>
<p>Inclusion of hierarchy in the section on Fundamentals of Bureaucracy
does not imply that hierarchy is a required feature of bureaucracy.
Hierarchies of bureaucrats are a conventional <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure">organizational
structure</a> and are worth studying even if not essential to
bureaucracy. Understanding hierarchy is relevant to identifying
recurring behavior and patterns to leverage. Organizations of
bureaucrats can intentionally work against the use of hierarchy for
decisions, but the amount of effort needed to enable alternatives
results in hierarchy being a common approach.</p>
<p>Hierarchical decision-making is one option for coordination among
alternatives (like consensus, voting, or dictatorship), so why is
hierarchy so common? Members of an organization gravitate towards
hierarchy because it helps define task scope, assigns responsibility,
and obviates a need for building consensus. Reaching consensus or taking
a vote for every decision would take time and be more burdensome than
appointing a person as the decision-maker. At the other extreme, relying
on a dictator decreases the value other stakeholders can contribute.
There is a Pareto frontier of imperfect decision-making techniques when
multiple stakeholders are involved. Some approaches require more time
for the information to be gathered to inform a decision, others take
time due to consensus, while other approaches take less time by
involving fewer people but have poorer results from the decision.</p>
<p>The benefits of formal hierarchy include improved capacity for the
number of policy decisions made, enabling consistency of decisions, and
leveraging specialization of knowledge. Hierarchical decision-making has
costs: higher latency (compared to a single decider), inconsistency
among bureaucrats (dissemination isn't perfect), waste due to
inefficiency, <a href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">and others</a> like
enabling strategic ignorance. Bureaucrats in positions of power can deny
knowing of improper activity&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2019_McGoey 2012_McGoey">(McGoey 2019, 2012)</span>. Whether
that is a problem or benefit depends on your role.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="why-does-hierarchical-structure-arise-in-organizations">Why does
Hierarchical Structure Arise in Organizations?</h4>
<p>In an ideal situation for managing access to a shared resource, one
person would have sufficient depth of knowledge and breadth of
information for decision-making. That might not be possible in every
situation. One way to resolve this is to identify distinct scopes of
responsibility and then assign different members of an organization
separate scopes for decision-making. Within a decision-making scope
there may be more work than one person can handle, so a team is formed.
That team may have some members focused on tactical work and other
members focused on coordination. Hierarchy within an organization is the
formalization of separate decision-making scopes and associated
specialization.</p>
<p>Partitioning knowledge and decision-making enable complex work beyond
what one person can do and causes friction among members. An expert
reporting to a manager knows things the manager does not, and the
manager may have context that the expert lacks. Both bureaucrats (the
expert and the manager) need to convey their respective understanding
and seek a holistic view.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="characterizing-hierarchy">Characterizing
Hierarchy</h4>
<p>A conventional characterization of an organization's hierarchy
involves two criteria: the depth and breadth of the <span
data-acronym-label="org chart" data-acronym-form="singular+short">org
chart</span>. The more people a supervisor oversees, the flatter the
organization -- that's the breadth of the organization. The depth of the
hierarchy is how many layers there are. See the Valve handbook&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="2012_Valve">(unknown 2012)</span> and
Joreen's essay&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="1972_Joreen">(Freeman
1972)</span> for contrasting views on the merits of an organization's
hierarchy.</p>
<p>Organizations that try to be flatter (more employees per manager)
saturate the attention of managers. As a result there are more
discussions that everyone has to pay attention to so they don't miss
something happening. The opposite design (fewer employees per manager)
is less noisy but results in silos of reporting because lateral
coordination is more challenging.</p>
<p>Another view of an organization's hierarchy also involves two
criteria. The two choices that shape hierarchy are how many people a
supervisor oversees and how many supervisors a person has. You might
na&#xEF;vely expect that an employee has one boss, but that is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management">not a
requirement</a>. A supervisor for a given topic may have many people
reporting to them, and a bureaucrat with multiple roles may report to
more than one supervisor.</p>
<p>Often the concept of hierarchy intended to describe the relations in
an organization is not representative of actual relationships among
coworkers. For that reason, the concept of roles is another way to
characterize interactions. Roles are defined by boundaries of
responsibility in an organization. Similar to the motive for hierarchy,
the purpose of a role is to minimize conflict, decrease the need for
coordination, reduce redundancy, and allow for control of resources.
Clear boundaries of responsibility enable effective bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The structure of an organization is dynamic, but at each point in
time an organization typically has a defined set of roles. Different
scopes of decision authority distinguish each role. Titles determine who
reports to whom.</p>
<p>In your practice of Process Empathy, consider the roles and titles of
bureaucrats you collaborate with and rely on. A person may have more
roles than titles, and the two are loosely correlated. Your perception
of another person's role may not match their self-perceived role. You
can seek to better understand each person's expectations.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="sequencing-dissemination-of-information">Sequencing Dissemination of
Information</h4>
<p>A hierarchical organization with partitioned knowledge introduces a
challenge: the order in which you share information with others matters.
Your choices for who to first describe an idea to are your peers, your
management, and the people you manage. The people you manage know more
about the topic and are exposed to the consequences. Giving them a
chance to vet the idea results in a more robust idea and validates their
value in the organization. Alternatively, first sharing your idea with
management allows your superiors to provide context you might not be
aware of. And choosing to start the conversation with your peers first
indicates you value the relationship and decreases the risk of
duplicating work. There is no right answer.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="autonomy-in-a-hierarchical-organization">Autonomy in a Hierarchical
Organization</h4>
<p>Acting as part of a group means ceding part of your autonomy.
Hierarchy cedes some of your responsibility and adds expectations about
relationships. The consequence of hierarchy in an organization is that,
as a member of the bureaucracy, you do not have full autonomy --
otherwise you would not be a member of the hierarchy. At the same time,
you are not under strict control of the organization -- you still have
some subjective authority as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>In a hierarchy, the upward flow of decision authority and
justification is a feature, not a bug. If justifications and decisions
were bidirectional that would be consensus and take more time.</p>
<p>The person at the top of the hierarchy does not know everything. The
person at the top of the hierarchy does not have input on every decision
made in the organization. All members of the bureaucracy retain some
autonomy.</p>
<p>The autonomy retained by members of a hierarchy can result in
problems for participants. One example is when a member seeks upward
communication and skips engaging the person directly above them in the
chain of command. A similar problem occurs in the opposite direction
when a person higher up engages someone far below them without
coordinating with the management between them. This is referred to as
"skip-level meetings" by Grove in&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1995_Grove">(Grove 1995)</span>. In both these cases,
neglecting to engage middle management risks missing relevant context
necessary for effective communication. Middle managers can get nervous
or frustrated when they aren't part of the conversation.</p>
<p>Another challenge induced by hierarchy for nominally autonomous
members is direct communication between lateral peers. If you think of a
hierarchical organization using the labels a family tree, the members of
your team are your siblings and the team manager is the parent. Talking
with your peers on other teams is engaging with your cousins. When
discussions with your professional work cousins is informal and ad hoc,
that can disrupt the intended flow of coordination between your manager
and the other team's manager. This can interfere with the focus and
priorities of each team.</p>
<p>Finally, the challenge for autonomous members is uncoordinated
broadcasting of information to the entire hierarchical organization.
Because each person lacks a holistic understanding of the complex
organization, angst and misinterpretation can occur. The typical fix is
to rely on upward and downward propagation of information in the chain
of command. That way local context can be applied at each layer specific
to the audience.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="roles-outside-the-hierarchy">Roles Outside
the Hierarchy</h4>
<p>Independent of the defined roles and formal titles in an
organization's hierarchy, there are a set of implicit roles and a
separate social hierarchy of informal influencers and decision-makers.
Informal influencers in a bureaucracy usually have long relationships
with the decision-maker, relevant credentials, or both. The credentials
can be formal (e.g., a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy">PhD</a>) or
informal (demonstrated success on a project). In either case, the
decision-maker is relying on another person's expertise.</p>
<p>Another set of informal relationships within an organization is
between mentors and mentees. These relations allow mentors to share
institutional knowledge with mentees and enable people in senior
positions to access the novice perspective.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="fear-induced-by-hierarchy">Fear Induced by
Hierarchy</h4>
<p>One consequence of hierarchy is a sense of fear felt by people who
report to other people. This fear stems from the loss of control (less
autonomy) that leaves the person feeling disempowered.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following relationship. Sue is perceived to
have power over another person, Amy, because Amy gave up some control to
Sue. Amy's lack of control over decisions triggers the feeling of fear
in Amy, regardless of how Sue behaves. (See Figure&nbsp;<a
href="#fig:subordinate_and_supervisor" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:subordinate_and_supervisor">1.5</a>.) Having
responsibility for decisions also induces anxiety.</p>
<figure id="fig:subordinate_and_supervisor">

style="width:60.0%" />
<figcaption>Sue and Amy discuss a work-related topic. The person with
less perceived power can feel fear associated with loss of
control.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If Sue is aware of the potential for this emotional experience, Sue
can compensate for Amy's fear by being friendly and receptive towards
Amy. Alternatively Sue may exploit or rely on the fear felt by the
people she manages. Sue not noticing or accounting for Amy's fear does
not invalidate Amy's emotional experience.</p>

data-acronym-form="singular+short">org chart</span>") is a document that
identifies formal roles and the formal relations among roles. An org

descriptive. Despite possible deficiencies, an org chart helps outsiders
and newcomers understand the scope of responsibilities and
interactions.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"

chart serves as a guide is to identify who in the organization is

<p>Org charts are a lie because undocumented relationships can matter
more than official roles. Org charts fail to capture the informal roles

<p>In an organization comprised of more than one person, meetings are

meeting can be explicit (verbal or written), or it can be indirect
through signaling (who attended the meeting, when the meeting was held,
where the meeting was held, or how much notice was provided).</p>
<p>Not everyone understands that meetings are vital to coordination in a

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: No plan or coordination needed; I just do
what I'm told. With this approach, either I will be successful because I
worked hard on what my supervisor directed, or I will fail because my
supervisor directed me to do the wrong thing.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: You are smart, and you're
capable of shaping your career. Let's work as a team to improve your
effectiveness.<br />
<em>Another potential response by the supervisor</em>: Is that how you
want your career to go? Or do you desire autonomy and creativity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: No point in making a plan or coordinating
because everything changes so often.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: But the work has an end
goal, right?<br />
<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: Yes, so then the plan is to get from where
we are now to that end goal. Coordinate as necessary.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: And there are no
intermediary steps? Milestones? Is it better to have no plans and just
put out fires as a reaction, or to have a plan with contingencies that
are subject to change?</p>

collaboratively specifying a goal, enumerating tasks that would support
the goal, identifying the dependencies among the sub-tasks, and
time-binning the dependencies with defined milestones and deliverables.
That is my definition of a plan. And having those elements of planning

<em>Anti-meeting view</em>: Who's plan? Who's relationships? I don't
need to come up with that plan, my supervisor already has a plan. Just
tell me what the plan is.<br />
<em>Potential response by the supervisor</em>: That's not as effective
as coming up with independent plans and then resolving the differences.
There's value in resolving the differences, even though that will cost
time and could create frustration.</p>

Not every team member in a bureaucracy is against planning, or as
obstinate about collaboration. My intent for sharing these debates is
that you will be less surprised when your coworkers raise them. Process

id="fundamental-written-communication">Fundamental: Written
Communication<span id="sec:written-communication"
label="sec:written-communication"></span></h3>
<p>As with hierarchy, written communication is not required for
bureaucracy. Policies and processes don't have to be written down.
However, written communication is extremely common and can be helpful.
For example, policymakers typically don't need to be present for
consultation by the administering bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Paperwork, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tape">red
tape</a>, and modern electronic forms are closely associated with
bureaucracy. Digital reports, spreadsheets, and emails are the current
technological artifacts of an organization's bureaucracy. A written
record creates evidence about policies, justifications, and decisions
regardless of format. Written records are burdensome to create and
maintain and search, but they are not intrinsically good or bad.</p>
<p>Becoming skilled at creating written records is crucial for being an
effective bureaucrat. You may have some education on spelling, grammar,
and composing essays, but the artifacts of bureaucracy have distinct
best practices. For example, plagiarism can be good -- you're being
consistent and efficient. Chapter&nbsp;<a
href="#sec:communication-within-bureaucracy" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:communication-within-bureaucracy">6</a>
provides advice on effective verbal and written communication in the
context of a bureaucratic organization.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="fundamental-feedback-loops-and-ripples">Fundamental: Feedback Loops
and Ripples<span id="sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples"
label="sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples"></span></h3>
<p>A feedback loop exists when a decision-maker experiences the harms
and benefits of their decision. Decisions that lack a feedback loop
still have consequences for the decision-maker, in that potential future
decisions are altered or limited.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Virtuous cycles and vicious cycles are rare in bureaucratic
organizations because there are rarely mechanisms for feedback loops.
Instead, there are ripples -- propagation of consequences for other
people's schedules, altering what is possible for other people, and
creating dependent tasks to be carried out by people other than the
decision-maker.</p>
<p>The weak feedback mechanisms for a bureaucrat are reputation (subject
to spin) and rarely enforced retroactive accountability in the form of
the question, "What did you know and when did you know it?" Retroactive
accountability depends on written records from meeting notes, emails,
agendas, and reports. Reducing the potential for retroactive
accountability is one motive for bureaucrats avoiding written records
for decisions and policies.</p>
<p>When there are multiple competing objectives among stakeholders in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum</a> use
of resources (my win is your loss), how can you determine what's best?
In some domains there are feedback loops to guide progress. When
feedback loops are weak or not present, the most powerful stakeholder
(potentially distinct from the biggest or loudest) will dominate.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="approvals-and-justifications">Approvals and
Justifications</h4>
<p>Because of the lack of quantitative feedback loops for bureaucrats,
there is significant interest in documenting justification, proactive
monitoring, reporting, and retroactive assessment. Each of those
activities creates more administrivia. Deepening your Process Empathy
involves looking for feedback loops (which are rare) and understanding
what arises in place of feedback loops.</p>
<p>Because feedback loops are weak for decision-makers, alternative
mechanisms are needed in bureaucracy. A standard approach is the use of
approvals and justifications. The strength of justification needed for a
given action depends on your relationship with the approver and the
potential ripples associated with the action.</p>
<p>Three motives for justifications are common. By understanding which
motive is driving the request for justification, you can tailor your
justification to be more successful. The first motive is to provide
evidence that the action is consistent with policy. A second motive for
requiring justification is to help a decision-maker judge the risk
involved with the action. Lastly, a motive for justification is to
inform the decision maker about the value of the action so they can
compare with other possible investments.</p>
<p>As an example of how to apply that recognition of different motives,
consider a manager who views compliance with policy as crucial for the
continued operation of the team. A justification that cites specific
policies as part of the reasoning signals your understanding of the
manager's concern. A different manager who you need input from regarding
a politically sensitive topic may not have written policy guidance and
instead needs to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of your
request.</p>
<p>The level of detail of a justification can vary. You can tailor the
strength of the reasoning to your audience's needs, saving yourself and
them time. Examples of the different levels of detail include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I have no explanation.</p></li>
<li><p>This is my opinion.</p></li>
<li><p>We've always done it that way. (This indicates a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a> approach
in which the underlying reasoning is not understood by
participants).</p></li>
<li><p>Based on my experience.</p></li>
<li><p>I was told to do it this way.</p></li>
<li><p>I think this is the best way (no reasoning, but a desire to
optimize; optimization criterion undefined).</p></li>
<li><p>This way is most effective because X (where X is not quantified,
there is a desire to optimize, and there is an optimization

<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="special-interest-groups-can-be-harmful">Special Interest Groups can
be Harmful</h4>
<p>Within bureaucratic organizations, special interest groups care about
specific aspects of the shared resource central to the organization.
Inefficiency can occur when there is a benefit to a small group and the
cost is to a larger group.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_trap">social
trap</a> is "a conflict of interest or perverse incentive where
individuals or a group of people act to obtain short-term individual
gains, which in the long run leads to a loss for the group as a
whole."<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The feedback loop for the diffused
value relevant to the organization is weaker than the feedback loop for
value to the interest group.</p>
<p>Confronting an individual about a group problem usually results in "I
can't fix everyone else's behavior." Similarly, a team that is
benefiting at a cost to the organization is unmotivated to change. A way
to productively engage is to get all stakeholders in an in-person
meeting. This social pressure, combined with the prompt to find a way to
limit harmful behavior, can encourage brainstorming of better
approaches.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="spending-taxpayer-dollars-is-a-weak-feedback-loop">Spending Taxpayer
Dollars is a Weak Feedback Loop</h4>
<p>As an example of a weak feedback loop, consider the scenario of a
government employee deciding how to spend government money.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Suppose you are a government bureaucrat and earn $100,000 with a tax
rate of 30%. That means you pay $30,000 in taxes to the government. How
does that compare to what the government collects in taxes?</p>
<p>For the United States, "in 2021 the government collected $4.05
trillion in revenue."<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>That means your taxes of $30,000 would be 30000/4050000000000 =
0.00000074% of the tax base for the country.</p>
<p>If you are a federal government bureaucrat and you do not maximize
the effectiveness of spending $1,000,000 of government money, of that
misallocated money only $0.0074, or about one penny, was taxes you paid.
The financial feedback loop is weak.</p>
<p>Some federal government bureaucrats earn more money, so the cost of
wasting $1,000,000 is increased. Federal pay is limited to about
$220,000<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"

<p>The lack of feedback allows waste to go unfelt. There's no immediate
consequence for the decision-maker.</p>
<h4 data-number="1.4.0.1" id="example-feedback-loops"><span
class="header-section-number">1.4.0.1</span> Example Feedback Loops</h4>
<p>A feedback loop in bureaucracy can be abstract, so this section
features stories illustrating the concept.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>A coworker and I were going through passport control at an airport. A
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration">Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) officer</a> was directing passengers into
one of two lines. Both lines were long. The length of each line was not
equal even though the entrance to the lines was at the same location.
Each line terminated at a row of passport-checking agents. Each passport
check took a minute. Passport-checking TSA officers operate
independently and concurrently.</p>
<p>The TSA officer's perspective is that there are two long lines. Her
procedure is to balance the two lines (for fairness). She does this by
pointing people into one of the two lines, with her choice driven by
which line appears to have room available.</p>
<p>My coworker and I enter the controlled area and are directed into
lines by the TSA officer. The officer directs my coworker left and
directs me to go right. The TSA officer completed her job.</p>
<p>My coworker in the left line finishes 5 minutes before me. This
difference in completion time is frustrating for me.</p>
<p>Because the lines were not of equal length, balancing the start of
the line is a suboptimal method. The consequence is that what seems fair
to the TSA officer ends up not being fair for people going through the
line. The TSA officer had incomplete information -- the lines were not of
equal length. Because the TSA officer isn't exposed to the consequence
of her approach, she didn't get feedback on whether her decisions are
suboptimal or not.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Lesson</em>: if the people making decisions do not experience the
consequences of those decisions, then they have no incentive to improve
decision-making.</p>
<p>The person in the longer line feels frustrated. The negative feeling
is due to a sense of powerlessness, the situation is recurring, and a
better solution is available.</p>
<p>The optimal solution in this situation is to have a single line
feeding the multiple TSA passport checkers. A single line eliminates the
need for the decision-maker but incurs work to change the status
quo.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Bob parks his car in a parking garage every day. The parking garage
owner charges $20 per day for people to park their car.</p>
<p>Bob recently found that one of the exit gates for the parking garage
is broken. If Bob uses that gate to leave the parking garage, the gate
does not function and Bob cannot exit. Then Bob has to call the parking
gate operator to request an exception (which is granted) and Bob can
then exit that gate, avoiding the $20 per day charge.</p>
<p>This action (go to the broken gate, request an exception, avoid the
charge) has been repeated for a long time (months). Bob's motive is to
avoid the $20 parking charge; the cost is a mere phone call and a minor
delay. This cheating behavior harms the parking garage owner's income.
However, the parking gate operator, serving as intermediary, insulates
the parking garage owner from interaction with the cheater. The cheating
behavior is small enough that the parking garage owner may not
notice.</p>
</div>
<p>Having an intermediary policy enforcer alleviates the need for the
garage owner to interact with customers. If the incentives of
stakeholders are not aligned then inefficiency goes unchecked. If the
parking garage operator's profits are a fixed rate rather than tied to
parking charges, then the operator lacks the motive to fix problems.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.5" id="history-of-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">1.5</span> History of Bureaucracy<span
id="sec:history" label="sec:history"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is widely disliked, yet it is widespread and persistent
across a variety of cultures. Bureaucracy has repeatedly arisen
independently in various societies<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> lasting for timescales
that exceed the lifespan of one person.<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
That indicates the current situation is not a fluke or coincidence.
There may be both utility and lack of alternatives, or perhaps a
consistently recurring pathology.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy predates writing and language and even humans! Policy
enforcement in support of an organization arises in pre-human tribes,
visible in groups of modern apes who have to manage access to shared
resources&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2016_Suchak">(Suchak et al.
2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Though bureaucracy is not new, the pervasiveness is. Before the
industrial revolution the scale of employment and government was small
relative to today because organizations were limited by the speed of
communication. For the past 100+ years, the size of organizations (e.g.,
commercial, governmental, and academia) has grown beyond <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar's
number</a> -- the number of human relationships you can maintain (about
150). More people participate in more organizations that are more
bureaucratic. Driving this increase is the support for more complex
products and processes.</p>
<div class="center">
<figure id="fig:complexity_and_staff_growth">
<img src="images/feedback_loop_complexity_and_staffing.png"
style="width:80.0%" />
<figcaption>Increased complexity requires more staffing to enable
specialization. More staff means more skills are available;
under-utilized staff skills make room for more scope; more scope adds to
complexity.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Extrapolation of trends is easy: the more interconnected the society
is, and with more people, and with more complicated products then more
bureaucracy should be expected. If society reduces in size and reduces
to tools we can make with only our hands then bureaucracy could
decrease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Since society might stay the same or get more interconnected for a
while, learning about bureaucracy is a worthwhile investment. And if you
want to reduce or eliminate bureaucracy, understanding what would be
displaced is crucial. Happily, as described in the next chapter, you
already have experience to build on.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.1"

class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Avoiding Bureaucracy is Nearly
Impossible</h2>
<p>The only situation where bureaucracy might not exist is if you live
entirely independently and have no interaction with other people. That
means completely disengaging from society. Even then, personal routines
are a self-imposed form of bureaucracy, with the roles of policymaker,
bureaucrat, and subject collapsed to a single person -- you.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency and autonomy are attractive alternatives to
bureaucracy. The way participants in modern society strive for
self-sufficiency is by denying their dependence on modern society.
That's a relabeling of selfishness which feels better.</p>
<p>For the rest of us who operate as members of society, bureaucracy is
necessary for our rights. You validate your name using paperwork, forms,
and records. These artifacts are used, in cooperation with other people,
to determine your claim of citizenship and associated rights. That's a
policy that stakeholders in society agree to.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is useful as a response to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem">collective
action problem</a> -- everyone would benefit from cooperation, but each
person has to sacrifice their self-interests. As long as humans form
communities, we will address the challenge of shared resources -- whether
tangible (e.g., water, land, air) or intangible (e.g., expertise,
information). That is why bureaucracy is culturally invariant and
persistent across time. Learning to be an effective bureaucrat improves
your chances of success in society.</p>
<p>The specific way society is constructed (democratic, authoritarian,
dictatorship, anarchy) is irrelevant -- bureaucracy is still present.
Even the libertarian approach of relying on contract enforcement implies
some bureaucracy (e.g., forums for resolving contract disputes like a
court system, enforcing decisions through violence).</p>
<p>Not all bureaucracy is due to the state, nor is bureaucracy confined
to companies. Parenting involves creating situation-specific
requirements for children, with the organization being the family as
mentioned in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:family-of-bureaucrats"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:family-of-bureaucrats">1.1</a> and the next section
that describes <a href="#sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood">bureaucracy in

Store clerks are bureaucrats, as are website forum moderators. Content
moderation is the process of enforcing standards.</p>
<p>Recognizing instances of bureaucracy enables more skillful
interaction, whether as a bureaucrat or subject. The rest of this

bureaucracy as a <span data-acronym-label="subject"

<p>You have experience with bureaucracy, though you may not have framed
the experiences as bureaucratic. You might not have used the labels of
policymaker, bureaucrat, or subject, but you may have acted in all three
roles. If you recognize you've been acting as a bureaucrat you'll be
able to apply relevant skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In each person's life there are milestones like birth, education, work,
and death. Each of these milestones and phases involves bureaucracy, so
you have experience with each of the roles that constitute bureaucracy.
Each phase in your life provides a different experience of
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is composed of three roles: the policy creator, the
policy enforcer, and the subject (upon whom the policy is inflicted).
Who is the bureaucrat and who is the subject depends on the relationship
in a scenario. For example, a store manager creates a policy, a store
clerk enforces the policy, and the policy is inflicted on the customer.
The customer is the subject of bureaucracy. In a separate example,
someone at corporate headquarters sets a policy, the store manager
enforces it, and the policy is inflicted on the store clerk. Then the
clerk was the subject of bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-of-birth">Bureaucracy of
Birth<span id="sec:bureacracy-of-birth"
label="sec:bureacracy-of-birth"></span></h3>
<p>Your birth was marked by getting a name, registering with the state,
and initiating medical records. These tasks were administered by
bureaucrats (doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff) on your behalf,
and you were the subject of the bureaucracy. You had no autonomy or
decision-making authority.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucracy-in-early-childhood">Bureaucracy
in Early Childhood<span id="sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood"
label="sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood"></span></h3>
<p>Before starting formal education, the bureaucracy of early childhood
is inflicted primarily by family members setting and carrying out
policies. The organization of bureaucrats is the family, with the shared
resources being housing, food, and experience with survival. Other
community members or caretakers may also be involved in carrying out the
policies of taking care of you. Your decision-making authority as a
subject in this bureaucracy was minimal.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucrats-at-school">Bureaucrats at
School<span id="sec:bureaucracy-of-school"
label="sec:bureaucracy-of-school"></span></h3>
<p>Once you started the formal education process, new bureaucrats got
involved. The community of bureaucrats could be a public school, a
private school, or homeschooling. In any of those cases, the frontline
bureaucrat is the teacher. You're not responsible for making policies
that other people follow; you are still the subject of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The expectations of each phase of school (high school, undergraduate,
graduate school) are distinct, and they are different from working in a
large organization. Your autonomy increases throughout the duration of
school. Your family and teachers are the bureaucrats. You start building
informal organizations of friends, and you start to explore policies
around social bonding.</p>
<p>Schooling sets a pattern that most students will fall into for the
rest of their lives: you were handed a textbook and told to solve a set
of problems. That pattern of taking direction can persist for a long
time. However, you are not constrained to persist with that limitation.
You have the autonomy to do more than what is required. You can find
other textbooks that match your interests or are written from a
different view.</p>
<p>You get to choose the book you want, even if you don't get to choose
the topic you will be evaluated on. You don't need to pick just one
reference book -- you can review lots of books and figure out which
author style best fits you. You can also choose the level of difficulty
-- basic and beginner level, or more advanced. You can choose what's best
based on your understanding rather than defer to what a class in school
is supposed to cover. (This same paradigm applies later in life when you
become a bureaucrat or policymaker -- you can be mediocre as a default,
or you can make extra effort to be more effective.)</p>
<p>As a subject of the education bureaucracy, you can discover how you
learn best. This extra effort requires self-reflection: How do you
learn? What works best? What didn't work, and why not? What did you
learn? What do you wish you had learned?</p>
<p>Another pattern that schooling relies on is single-question decisions
with only one right answer. Examples include math problems and
multiple-choice tests. Schooling tends to avoid setting up dilemmas or
paradoxes for students. Academic problems in the education process are
designed to be independent of the people involved or the history of the
situation.</p>
<p>Schooling teaches how to analyze technical issues and develop
solutions. That problem-solution paradigm neglects the crucial steps of
discovering the problem, isolating the challenge, identifying
stakeholders, learning the history of the challenge, and negotiating
with stakeholders before trying to address the challenge. These
additional aspects are the skills relevant for being an effective
bureaucrat. Academic problems are intended to be solvable and answers
submitted get evaluated. In contrast, working in a bureaucratic
organization the challenges are ill-defined, there's no known solution,
and the topic is sufficiently complex that you have to collaborate.</p>
<p>For some students schooling can emphasize academics over socializing.
When transitioning to professional work social skills and political
savvy are necessary when trying to change the policies of your team or
organization. An effective bureaucrat is more than just book-smart.</p>

Transitioning from military to civilian life can present a dissonance
for service members used to the chain of command and clearly defined
orders. In comparison, bureaucratic organizations with hierarchical
structures are not as rigid as the military.</p>
<p>For members of the military, hierarchy and application of inefficient
policies feels stifling. Once out of the military, veterans may reflect
fondly on the clarity of orders compared to the vagaries of professional
workplace politics. Bureaucrats rely on both formal and informal
channels for quid quo pro interactions and sanctions. There's less
clarity compared to the military, but also more flexibility and
autonomy.</p>

<p>Organizations with communal workspaces have shared resources:
bathrooms, conference rooms, storage areas, and kitchen areas with
fridges and microwaves. Each of these incur policies of use. Unlike
being a student at school, you may find yourself responsible for
developing and enforcing policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As an example of workplace policies, consider the following
scenario.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>The bathroom at work sometimes smells, so I'm a nice person and bring
a scented air freshener. Unbeknownst to me, that triggers asthma or an
allergic reaction in one of my coworkers. Because of this a policy gets

<p>Signs are posted. Violations are reported to management even if no
one has a physical reaction to the air freshener.</p>
</div>
<p>Policies are often created in response to specific incidents. This
intent can be helpful (promulgating lessons learned is efficient) or
unhelpful (when policies are an overreaction).</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="healthcare-and-death">Healthcare and

<p>Medical care alters our life, so understandably a lot of money is
spent on medical care: 25% of the federal budget in the United
States&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2023_cbpp">(Editor
2023)</span>. Understanding the bureaucracy of healthcare is outside the
scope of this book, but your role in the bureaucracy is helpful to
understand.</p>
<p>Doctors, nurses, and other staff are bureaucrats, the patient is the
subject, and the hospital or clinic is the organization. The shared
resource is expertise in providing healthcare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
To illustrate the bureaucracy of a large organization, consider the
importance of toilet paper at a hospital.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>If you go to a hospital, use the bathroom, and find there is no
toilet paper, that would indicate a deficiency of the hospital.</p>
<p>Since the person who usually restocks toilet paper wasn't also a
user, they aren't directly affected by the lack of toilet paper.
Therefore a new routine is needed for checking the availability of
toilet paper in bathrooms.</p>
<p>The <em>perspective of the purchasing manager</em> is that money
spent checking the status of toilet paper is money not spent on the
hospital's primary mission: improving the health of community
members.</p>
<p>A feedback mechanism is instituted: a phone number is posted in the
bathroom so users can send a text regarding bathroom status at the
hospital.</p>
</div>
<p>Bureaucracy is a set of subjectively administered policies within an
organization. By recognizing the role of bureaucrats you can identify
what is negotiable.</p>

class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Bureaucrat's View of Their
Organization<span id="sec:alternative-views-from-within"
label="sec:alternative-views-from-within"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy <a href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">as defined in this
book</a> is not the only way that bureaucrats perceive their
environment. To understand their situation, bureaucrats may create a
narrative involving themselves, their work, their subjects, their
coworkers, their supervisors, and the people they manage. Complicating
this story, the <a href="#sec:motivations">motives of an individual
bureaucrat</a> for an activity vary. The variance of motivations is even
more complicated when a request incurs more work, there's no deadline,
and no reward. What is your incentive? Is it emotional approval?
Relationship building? Social approval?</p>
<p>Most bureaucrats don't self-identify as bureaucrats even if they do
recognize they operate in a bureaucratic organization. The common
paradigm is, "I'm an engineer and the company I work for is
bureaucratic," or "I'm a manager and my team is distracted by too much
administrativia," or "My coworker Paul is not like me -- he doesn't
respond to my messages."</p>
<p>As a consequence of not thinking about the bureaucratic system you
operate within, a typical response is to develop heuristics that fit the
recurring patterns you've experienced. While that feels like learning,
the heuristics you develop are specific to your motives and your
experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The perspectives below are archetypal for bureaucrats who don't consider
bureaucracy <a href="#sec:define-bureaucracy">as defined</a> in this
book. In practice, a practitioner's perspective might be a mixture of
these views. The descriptions of bureaucracy below are both wrong and
harmful. The source of the harm is that if you use the framing to guide
your actions you'll be less effective compared to process empathy
framing. The alternative framings are listed so they can be contrasted
with Process Empathy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>As a bureaucrat, what matters is what I can do with my skills
and the resources I have access to.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: This person is task oriented. Results are what
matters. The intricacies of bureaucracy are a distraction to getting the
work done. Communication for coordination is a distraction from work
being done by the individual. This bureaucrat may have the perception
that if they participate in the organization then they will be blamed
when things go wrong. The emotional reward for this person is doing or
completing the task. This person is likely to say to their manager,
"Tell me what I need to do to be successful" rather than identify
collaborations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>As a bureaucrat, what matters is how I feel.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Your feelings are real. They have consequence, in
that your emotions affect motivation and enthusiasm. However, a
feelings-centric perspective may not be productive for you, your team,
or the organization. Brainstorming can feel unpredictable. Challenging
statements made by coworkers may feel intimidating. Talking about tough
topics is emotionally difficult. Being effective means compromise and
some people may not get everything they wanted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What matters is how others feel.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Depending on the emotional state of those around
you is unhealthy and can be unproductive. Working for the happiness or
satisfaction of other people is risky -- they may not know what's best,
or they may not have your interests in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What matters are my immediate coworkers.</strong><br />
An approach to avoiding thinking about bureaucracy is to characterize
interactions with other people merely as personal relationships. That is
easier than thinking of bureaucracy as the complex system that exceeds
your local view.</p>
<p>This perspective can be positive (e.g., I collaborate with those
around me) or negative (e.g., I compete with those around me). In this
scenario everything beyond the local scope is personified or
ignored.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Your relationships do matter. However, they are not
all that matters. Missing from this view is the ability to explain what
is happening outside the immediately observable realm. This "just
relationships" view misses emergent phenomena and over-simplifies the
situation. As a result your effectiveness is decreased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Just because you are a bureaucrat doesn't mean you have a well-informed
understanding of bureaucracy. Regardless of which of the above
perspectives is held, a bureaucrat experiences the difficulties of
operating within an organization. A bureaucrat can rationalize to
themselves why things don't work in their organization with stories
like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Other people are lazy and don't want to work.</p></li>
<li><p>Other people are inexperienced.</p></li>
<li><p>Other people don't care.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are lazy people, inexperienced people, and people who don't
care in any given organization. Those are not unique to bureaucracy and
do not explain bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The bureaucrat who uses explanations like laziness, lack of
experience, and lack of care applies them to people he or she hasn't
directly interacted with. The bureaucrat using these explanations may
not realize other people could apply those same stories to the
bureaucrat.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="not-many-options-for-organizations"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Not Many Options for
Organizations</h2>
<p>The effect of clustering bureaucrats into organizations or teams can
be to hide the complexity of enacting policies for managing access to
shared resources. The value of organizations and teams is that they are
a simplifying abstraction that depersonalizes the function of inputs and
outputs. Without organizations or teams you would be directly exposed to
the complexity of knowing every person's title and responsibility.
Organizations and teams are abstractions to hide complexity.</p>
<p>When complaining about the ineptitude of organizations (or more
specifically, leaders, managers, bureaucrats you manage, and coworkers),
consider the variables available to be modified. As a thought exercise,
what would it take to rebuild the organization you are in from
scratch?</p>
<p>Listing the levers available for enacting change in an organization
is intended to emphasize the importance of personal interactions within
bureaucracy. When you get frustrated with inefficiency, consider the
systemic changes available -- there aren't that many. Options for
restructuring the organization are limited, so the importance of your
creativity and informal influence is dominant in determining the
effectiveness of bureaucracy. Those factors relevant to Process Empathy
are separate from having the right staff and being able to have an
adequate number of staff.</p>
<p>Organizations comprised of bureaucrats have fewer options for change
than individual bureaucrats. The choices an individual bureaucrat faces
are described in the section on <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a>. In comparison, the structural
choices faced by the designers of an organization include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Flatness of organizational hierarchy -- how many layers of
oversight are there? Another way of arriving at the same structure is to
ask how many employees there are per supervisor.</p></li>
<li><p>Hierarchy split by function (all the lawyers in one team, all the
engineers in one team, all the sales people in one team) or by product
(mixing experts to solve a customer's problem)?</p></li>
<li><p>Size of organization. Having more people allows for more
specialization and requires more support.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not all changes have to be structural; there are choices to be made
when operating within the existing hierarchy. Organizations create
processes for recurring tasks like hiring, promotion (pay or title),
awards, compensation, recognition, professional training, and firing.
Each of those has a set of design choices that inform the organization's
culture. The organization may have policies and processes regarding
hiring, promotion, training, and firing, but the decision may be made by
team managers rather than managers higher in the chain of command. In
some organizations (e.g., government), the constraints of some
incentives like pay and financial awards are set outside the
organization. That further constrains the ability of bureaucrats to
shape their organization's culture.</p>
<p>Organizations are more accountable to their source of funding; less
so to the subjects of bureaucracy or members of the organization. For
example, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service">Internal
Revenue Service (IRS)</a> is accountable to Congress, not taxpayers or
IRS employees.</p>
<p>A flat organization (more employees per manager) means more people
doing work instead of managing, but sufficiently large organizations are
typically broken into teams to make coordination less chaotic.</p>
<p>Organizations are segmented into teams and there are not many
options: create a new team, merge existing teams, or dissolve a
team.</p>
<p>Shuffling the structure of teams (referred to as re-organization) is
a favorite hobby of executive leadership. The alignment of hierarchical
structure with an organization's purpose is a change that is easy to
point to as an accomplishment.</p>
<p>For a given set of teams, the lateral interactions are competitive or
cooperative. Coordination is required (or conflict will occur) for
money, staffing, and resources. Examples of resources include access to
or control of data, computer equipment, hardware, floor space in a
building, prestige, and ownership of products.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="not-many-options-within-teams">Not Many
Options Within Teams</h3>
<p>Similar to the limited number of options available for shaping
organizations, the choices faced by a team are limited. As a
consequence, relationships and effective communication are more
significant for effective bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Team managers might decide who gets hired, who gets promoted, who
goes to what training, and who gets fired. Though in some environments
even that control is relegated to an external team. A team manager
usually has decision-making authority regarding tasks the team works
on.</p>
<p>Accountability in the context of teams comes from person-to-person
interactions. These can be either lateral (sideways), parent-child
(top-down), or child-parent (bottom-up)&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2014_Jorgensen">(Jorgensen, Bruehl, and Franke 2014)</span>.
Each of these three categories has associated constraints.</p>
<p>The upward child-parent (bottom-up) communication is either
inadequate (too few updates, not enough information, or insufficient
context), relevant, or excessive. For example, a weekly or monthly
report to multiple superiors may be inadequate.</p>
<p>Finding the balance depends on the presenter knowing the individual
audience members so that a tailored message is provided and then
adapting to the specifics of the situation.</p>
<p>The downward parent-child communication either is inadequate (no
direction provided or imprecise direction provided), provides actionable
vision, or micromanagement. Finding the right balance and specificity
requires insight into the communication needs on both sides of the
relationship. The manager of a team member has a variety of tools
available beyond setting tasks and deadlines. A manager can create an
environment that provides psychological safety, promotion based on
accomplishments, recognition of contributions, encouragement, and
constructive feedback.</p>
<p>For interactions among team members at the same hierarchical level
the conflict of interests between cooperation and competition manifests
in struggles over money, staffing, products (output), and resources
(inputs).</p>
<p>Understanding the options available for organizations, teams, and
relationships informs your Process Empathy. There are constraints
bureaucrats operate within and there are a limited number of ways to
evolve out of a situation. By listing possible ways to change you can
identify which options are best to invest in.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="roles-of-management-versus-leadership">Roles
of Management versus Leadership</h3>
<p>Teams include managers and leaders. Those roles are not necessarily
filled by the same person. By clarifying the distinction, you can
determine what to expect from various members of the hierarchy. A common
mistake is to expect leadership from managers. (In fact, anyone can
lead!)</p>
<p>A manager's role involves time management, task tracking, employee
evaluations, promotion, pay, requesting resources for team members,
firing, and hiring. Sometimes the responsibilities of promotion, pay,
and hiring are split into a supervisor role, leaving task tracking and
time management to the roles of project manager or product manager.</p>
<p>A leader's role includes on coordinating vision and principles.
Vision can be either a destination (a specific outcome) or a direction
(an area of focus). The principles (or strategy) identify which
behaviors of team members are expected or shunned. The vision and
principles for the team do not have to originate from the leader -- other
team members can contribute ideas. The leader's responsibility includes
creating and renewing social consensus around the vision and
principles.</p>
<p>Another responsibility of team leaders is aligning the efforts of
members. That involves identifying roles, responsibilities, and
relationships. Roles get titles to label the responsibilities.
Relationships are codified by an <span data-acronym-label="org chart"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">org chart</span> that indicates who
reports what to whom.</p>
<p>As a thought experiment to illustrate the necessity of management and
leadership, consider an uncoordinated mob of people. How would a mob
create complex machines like a car, common electronic devices like a
computer, or large infrastructure like skyscrapers and bridges?</p>
<p>The complexity and size of <span
data-acronym-label="decentralized bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">decentralized bureaucracy</span>
requires managers and leaders even though the access to shared resources
is less easy to visualize. In the next section on friction the
difficulties of coordinating bureaucrats is reviewed. The understanding
of sources of friction is important for managers, leaders, and
bureaucrats to understand as part of their process empathy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="sources-of-friction-between-teams-within-an-organization">Sources of
Friction between Teams within an Organization</h3>
<p>Ideally there is a clear division of responsibilities among different
teams. Having separate teams requires interaction among teams -- one team
may depend on the output from another team. Coordination among the teams
regarding the transfer of data, products, projects, or knowledge is
critical to the smooth operation of the organization. Separation allows
for de-duplication of work and better transitions for work that spans
teams.</p>
<p>The division of responsibilities between teams can become unclear
because a team's scope tends to align with skills of the team members.
One team may be responsible for an aspect of a task workflow, but if
members of another team also have those skills (e.g., due to
cross-training), the separation of responsibilities can be blurred.</p>
<p>Another factor that leads to friction is the constraint that
organizations have finite staffing, money, and time. Therefore, teams
within the organization face a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum</a>
distribution of resources -- more for one team means less for everyone
else. While cooperation among teams would be efficient, competition
arises from the allocation of resources.</p>
<p>As with coordination among individual bureaucrats, a source of
friction for teams is the differences in perspective based on local
conditions, having insufficient education or experience, different
incentives, or different definitions of success. Ideally each team
shares the organization's vision, but in practice local conditions
influence decision-makers.</p>
<p>When trying to resolve friction between teams, there is an authority
common to the teams due to the hierarchical structure of
responsibilities. Based on their position in the organization, that
person is responsible for resolving conflict, lacks nuanced insight,
doesn't have time to get involved in every challenge, and doesn't want
to micromanage multiple teams. The resolution is often left to the
respective teams.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Consider two teams in an organization that interact, and each has
data storage and data processing capability. Allen's team sends Bob's
team data every week. Because the teams were built for different
purposes and at different times by different people, the data storage
capabilities used by each team are not compatible. Members of Allen's
team print all the records (usually about a hundred pages) and then
deliver the paper documents to Bob's team. Members of Bob's team then
retype all the information into the data storage used by Bob's team.</p>
<p>In a recent effort to modernize the office went paperless. Now
Allen's team sends Bob's team a set of PDF files. Members of Bob's team
type in the content from the PDFs into the database for Bob's team. This
is deemed a win for efficiency -- no more printing of paper documents
each week!</p>
<p>Why doesn't the organization common to both teams hire a data
scientist to automate the recurring data transfer? Or train the current
staff to learn to program a solution? Or create a third team that
manages a common server? Because the current staff skill set supports
printing and typing (data entry). Training someone with a new skill set
takes an investment of money, time, is an opportunity cost, and makes
them a flight risk. Hiring a data scientist is expensive. Whether the
task is feasible is uncertain from the view of Bob and his manager (they
both lack experience with the needed technology), and how long the task
will take is uncertain. Even once they create a connection, then a
person with the skill set to maintain it is needed. The cost of ongoing
maintenance and implementation is unknown.</p>
</div>
<p>The choices for resolving this friction between teams is to either
stick with the known working approach that is suboptimal and has a known
cost, or take a risk with unknown potential improvement of unknown
degree for an unknown capital and unknown ongoing cost. And if that
improvement works out, staff who were enacting the current solution
would need to find new work or learn new skills.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.5"
id="bureaucracy-as-accidental-legacy-or-essential"><span
class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Bureaucracy as Accidental,
Legacy, or Essential<span id="sec:accidental"
label="sec:accidental"></span></h2>
<p>Essential bureaucracy is the minimum set of processes, staffing, and
skills necessary to address the complexity of managing a community's
access to a <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span>. Achieving
this minimum is tricky since optimization can be with respect to
resilience to change, resilience to edge cases, staff turnover, speed
experienced by subjects, financial cost, time spent by the organization,
and the number of staff. Miss any one of those goals and the bureaucracy
is deemed inefficient.</p>
<p>Undesirable bureaucracy can be categorized as either accidental or
legacy. Accidental bureaucracy arises when someone misunderstands what
is needed or when skills of the bureaucrats involved are insufficient
for the complexity a problem. Legacy bureaucracy occurs when the
situation changes but processes do not.</p>
<p>Accidental and legacy bureaucracy accumulates within an organization.
Optimization of improved efficiency is at odds with change which
disrupts careers, relationships, and accumulated power.</p>
<p>Resolving each of these suboptimal conditions may seem easy: have
better knowledge of the problem, assign the right people to the problem,
and change processes as problems evolve. In practice, the easy
resolution is challenging.</p>
<p>Having enough knowledge is often infeasible, especially for complex
problems at a large scale. Having the people with the right skills
assumes that a pipeline of people with relevant talents exists and that
people in the pipeline won't be poached to work on other challenges.
Keeping up with evolving problems depends on having resources to change
(beyond the maintenance baseline) and having a defined approach for
changing the process.</p>
<p>The explanations of accidental and legacy bureaucracy are not
intended as excuses. By understanding the causes, you can better
differentiate accidental and legacy from essential bureaucracy.</p>

<p><em>You can read this list from a position of authority to take
action, or you can read this list as an advocate for
improvement.</em></p>
<p>In isolation, none of the following suggestions should be surprising.
However, enacting each idea requires ongoing investment. A champion is
needed to actively promote and support each idea.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Automate recurring decision processes. Automation
can decrease work and decrease the risk of inconsistent outcomes.
Automation is a way of encoding bureaucratic processes that convert
subjective decisions into repeatable steps.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Bureaucrats don't know how to
automate processes, or there isn't infrastructure available to support
automation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Where automation is infeasible for a process
involving multiple bureaucrats, make advocates with end-to-end authority
available to the subject. This improves the subject's experience of a
process. A benefit to the organization is that the advocate might see
opportunities for improvement not apparent to a bureaucrat responsible
for one step in the process.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: The organization may lack
incentives to provide customer advocates. When there is a customer
advocate, that person may not have the skills or time to exert
end-to-end oversight of the process.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make processes transparent to participants. This
improves the subject's understanding of a process. Transparency can help
with trustworthiness if the reasoning for actions is defensible.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Transparency may require technology
that is not central to the process. Transparency costs money that could
otherwise be spent on more tasks more central to the organization.
Transparency can provide data that is then used against the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make information discoverable (e.g., via search
engine).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Technology that isn't the core
strength of the organization is a distraction from the central work and
a cost in terms of staff and money.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make information directly available, rather than
mediated by a person.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Having to talk to a person
reinforces the importance of that person. The data owner feels needed,
and that can be emotionally rewarding. Whereas providing a pamphlet or
software application programming interface (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a>) is less
personal.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: After an interaction is completed, summarize the
steps and outcome for the participant.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Writing notes takes time away from
accomplishing work. The written notes may not adequately capture
nuances.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: When a process fails the needs of a participant,
investigate the failure and improve the process. Apply the practice of
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process">continual
improvement</a>.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: A way to detect failures is needed.
Why would that exist? A goal of improvement sounds good, but what
incentive does the bureaucrat have to improve?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make the goals and priorities of the organization
clear to all stakeholders. This enables accountability by allowing a
participant to point to dissonance.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Sharing goals enables
accountability.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Define measurable standards of performance, both
for individual bureaucrats and for teams. Again, accountability is a
feedback loop that needs a starting point for identifying
dissonance.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Carrying out measurements and
evaluating the results takes work. Also, measuring outcomes introduces
the risk of identifying failure. Then the organization looks
bad.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Train bureaucrats on how to engage participants
effectively; these interactions determine the culture of an
organization.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: If training is pursued at all,
justifying domain-specific technical training is easier.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Train bureaucrats through formal education or
through mentorship.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Formal training is a cost with an
unquantified benefit. Mentorship rarely results in promotion. The
attention of experienced mentors is a zero-sum investment that takes
away from time spent doing measurable work.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Make employment desirable to people who have
desirable characteristics (e.g., educated candidates).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Hiring less expensive candidates is
easier to justify.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Enhance accountability to peers (e.g., peer review
of actions and outcomes).</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Accountability is relevant if
improvement is desired and if you think your peers are in a position to
provide useful feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Look for ways to encourage organizations and
individual bureaucrats to improve and take risks rather than maintain
the status quo.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Deviating from the status quo means
taking risk. Specifically risk to incumbent power.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Decisions should be pushed down the hierarchy to
the practitioner. This is exemplified in Marquet's book <em>Turn the
Ship Around</em>&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2013_Marquet">(Marquet 2013)</span>.<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Power comes from decision-making.
Pushing decisions down the hierarchy means letting go of power.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: When making a decision requires cross-organization
interaction, form a team of practitioners.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Relying on practitioners to
coordinate takes management out of the critical path.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Supervisors should share the workload with their
team to gain practical exposure to current challenges.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: The skills a supervisor has may not
intersect with work being done by team members.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Seek feedback from process participants, then
provide status updates on the implementation of changes. This provides a
feedback loop and is a form of accountability.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Gathering feedback is an
opportunity cost for getting work done. If <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process">continual
improvement</a> isn't a basis for promotion of bureaucrats, there's
little motive to invest effort.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tip</em>: Replace sequential approval chains with a
concurrent review process. Sequential approval reduces the number of
ideas reaching later approvers by filtering good ideas as well as bad
ideas. Approvers may perform independent (redundant) due diligence and
end up disagreeing.</p>
<p><em>Why this doesn't happen</em>: Concurrent approval has the risk of
unnecessary work (someone says yes after someone else says no or asks
for more justification) and likely conflict when two reviewers
disagree.</p></li>

<p>You can leverage your improved understanding of bureaucracy by
changing your behavior. In this section I provide actionable
suggestions. This section provides prescriptions, whereas other sections
in this book like the <a href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a></p>
<p>and <a href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">unavoidable hazards</a></p>
<p>are descriptive. If you only have the prescriptions (and skip the
descriptions) you might get confused and frustrated as to why other
bureaucrats are not applying best practices.</p>
<p>I assume you are a good person, you have the relevant technical
skills for your duties, and you are a good <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management">project
manager</a>. Enacting Process Empathy is in addition to those
elements.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="characteristics-of-an-effective-bureaucrat">Characteristics of an
Effective Bureaucrat</h3>
<p>Bureaucracy is typically enacted by a system of distributed knowledge
and distributed decision-making, so coordination is critical. Here are
characteristics to strive for.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You communicate more effectively than anyone around you. This
applies to verbal and written communication, <a
href="#sec:effective-presentations">formal presentations</a> and <a
href="#sec:walk-arounds">informal interactions</a>.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: people plateau when there
is no incentive to improve. What level of quality is good enough depends
on the situation-specific risks and costs.</p></li>
<li><p>You facilitate meetings such that productivity is noticeably
improved. This means creating and sharing an agenda, providing rules on
interaction (e.g., raising hands), taking notes, sharing notes, and
following up with assigned tasks after the meeting.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: facilitation is rarely
taught explicitly. The work of facilitation is considered secondary to
the discussion even when the productivity of discussions is disastrous
and demoralizing.</p></li>
<li><p>You take part in meetings, whether that means actively
contributing or intentionally supporting other attendees. You leverage
relationships with other attendees.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: active participation
requires effort and exposes you to more risk than remaining
silent.</p></li>
<li><p>You invest effort in written communication (emails, text-based
chats, reports). Your writing empathizes with readers, captures relevant
context, is concise, and is clearly worded.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: writing-as-a-skill is
rarely the focus of a bureaucrat's work. Writing may be seen as skill
that doesn't require improvement. Finding role models that provide
examples of clear writing in bureaucratic organizations can be
challenging.</p></li>
<li><p>You communicate verbally concisely and precisely. You listen and
you teach. You seek shared definitions.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: Without a feedback
mechanism motivating urgency, bureaucrats tend to pontificate.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are in-person with colleagues, you walk around and talk
with people one-on-one.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: bureaucrats interested in
"just doing the work" view professional interactions as a distraction
that decreases productivity.</p></li>
<li><p>You are <a href="#sec:professional-vulnerability">professionally
vulnerable</a>.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: Sharing stories of your
personal experiences in the organization requires coherent narratives
that the listener can learn from. That talent is not taught to members
of most organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>In your role as bureaucrat you leverage project management
skills: you have a vision, you make and share plans, all while building
consensus with stakeholders.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: Consensus requires knowing
who is relevant to include and then investing in relationships that
allow iterative feedback. That use of time is costly. The level of
extroversion may not be attractive to every bureaucrat.</p></li>
<li><p>You apply your negotiation skills&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1982_Cohen">(Cohen 1982)</span> that improve your
interactions and outcomes.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: bureaucrats are not taught
negotiation unless it is an explicitly named responsibility for their
role.</p></li>
<li><p>You reply quickly to incoming requests, whether by answering
directly or acknowledging the request and providing a timeline for when
you will answer. This allows other people's tasks to either be resolved
or have a clear response about when progress can be expected. Other
participants in the organization then see you as reliable in a positive
sense.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: The coping skills of
responding to a large number of inbound requests either grows through
experience, is learned by watching role models, or just doesn't
happen.</p></li>
<li><p>You strive for and demonstrate transparency. You share
information with stakeholders. Transparency enables coordination without
interpersonal relationships.<br />
<em>Why this doesn't happen by default</em>: Transparency endangers
incumbents. Transparency requires an ongoing investment that doesn't
contribute to addressing the primary issue. Transparency requires
empathy with subjects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The superpowers of a bureaucrat that facilitate cooperation and progress
in any organization include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You seek information from stakeholders without burdening them.
When your requests are burdensome, you acknowledge that and seek ways to
pay back (or forward) their investment.</p></li>
<li><p>You apply consistent processes (rather than being reactionary and
applying ad hoc responses).</p></li>
<li><p>You hold others (and yourself) accountable for their actions.
Accountability is created by clearly stating objectives and then
measuring results.</p></li>
<li><p>You adapt to the varying incentives and reference experiences of
those around you. Flexibility enables interactions with diverse
coworkers.</p></li>
<li><p>You effectively multi-task or, more accurately, switch tasks. The
switch among tasks is triggered when the current task encounters an
externally-generated pause. You can <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)%23Concept_and_motivation">work
on a task while waiting for another task to finish</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You are prepared with a backlog of ideas (in writing) if someone
shows up with resources.</p></li>
<li><p>You know when to change communication channels (from text chats
to phone calls to in-person).</p></li>
<li><p>If you are dependent on someone else getting something done to
enable your progress, you can demonstrate priority by physically showing
up -- <u>presence creates priority</u>. Being physically at a person's
desk motivates that person to respond better than calling or emailing
them. Showing up where someone works and talking with them conveys how
much priority you place on the actions of the person you're talking
with.</p></li>
<li><p>You have intellectual empathy -- <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind">theory of mind</a>
for thinking -- as well as empathy for the emotions of others. You grow
your intellectual empathy by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_shadow">shadowing</a> peers and
bosses and coworkers and subordinates.</p></li>
<li><p>You have <span data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span>. You recognize
the deviations and exceptions that cause processes to come into
existence.</p></li>
<li><p>You focus on value delivery in relationships to a degree that
exceeds the scope of your formal role.</p></li>
<li><p>You have altered your job description to fit the growth you're
seeking.</p></li>
<li><p>You are willing to engage on a personal level and know
stakeholders outside their professional role.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of your tasks has a customer, a deadline, and a deliverable
artifact. You iterate towards a result.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You occasionally ponder and discuss with other people introspective
questions like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How can I be successful?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the ways I could fail?</p></li>
<li><p>How would the organization be characterized as
successful?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the ways the organization can fail?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You find mentors and ask them questions like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What do you like most about your career?</p></li>
<li><p>Given a chance, what would you do differently?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you manage work/life balance?</p></li>
<li><p>What's the big challenge for our industry in the next two
years?</p></li>
<li><p>How would you tackle that challenge?</p></li>
<li><p>What advice do you have for a young person starting in this
industry? In this organization?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there mistakes to avoid?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I be successful?</p></li>
<li><p>What books would you recommend reading?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although you strive to enact Process Empathy, do not expect that of
other people.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="frames-used-by-effective-bureaucrats">Frames
used by Effective Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>Being an effective bureaucrat is a mindset. There are various
framings that are useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Framing</em>: A bureaucrat can do more as part of an organization
than by working alone. Being a member of an organization means the
bureaucrat's identity is subsumed into service for the organization they
are part of.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> At the same time, bureaucracy
enables the bureaucrat to amplify their presence by being part of a
larger organization. That isn't always the case; sometimes the cost of
being part of the organization exceeds the force multiplier of working
together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Framing</em>: Measuring your personal growth in a bureaucracy is
difficult due to the lack of <a
href="#sec:feedback-loop-and-ripples">feedback loops</a>. One approach
is to measure your capabilities for a specific task. If you can complete
the task in less time, with fewer resources, and with less effort,
that's progress. If you can now complete a task that you previously
wanted to but weren't able to, that's progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Feelings</em>: Bureaucracy induces an emotional response in
participants because things don't work the way each person wants. This
can lead emotionally to frustration and then apathy. Understanding how
things work in a bureaucracy can help decrease the anger.</p>
<p>Another emotional response to bureaucracy is a sense of
powerlessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Some third person decides your fate: this is the whole essence of
bureaucracy&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1921_Kollontai">(Kollontai 1921)</span>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sense of powerlessness applies both to bureaucrats and to
subjects of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The sense of powerlessness is somewhat valid, in that you are as a
bureaucrat giving up some power compared to your ability to act
individually. That is the trade for working with other people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Feelings</em>: A process feels bureaucratic when there seems to be
dissonance. The subject faces a multi-step task that they can imagine
one person doing the same action in fewer steps and taking less time.
The illusion of decreased bureaucracy is created by consolidation from
the subject's perspective. The barrier to enacting consolidation is the
necessary coordination among different stakeholders who receive no
benefit from the consolidation. Externalizing the coordination to the
subject is what causes the sense of bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-be-an-effective-bureaucrat">How to be
an Effective Bureaucrat</h3>
<p>The following advice is specific to situations that you may not have
yet encountered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Work on three tasks concurrently.</strong> Don't
rely on one person or one idea for your success. On the other end of the
spectrum, don't spread yourself too thin. Working on a multitude of
projects decreases risk of any one outcome failing but also decreases
the amount of attention spent thinking about a specific challenge.</p>
<p>The three tasks should be at off-set stages (early, mid-way, and
nearing completion) rather than all being the same level of
maturity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: When you get stuck, use the following changes of
perspective: <strong>Look upstream, look downstream. Look to peers. Zoom
in (narrower scope) and zoom out (broader scope)</strong>. These are all
ways of changing the context. That change may help you identify
assumptions that are holding back progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: When you are asked to take on more work, <strong>avoid
responding with "That's not my job."</strong> If the request is
misguided and your perception is that another person has the
responsibility, ask if the requester is aware of that other person's
responsibilities. If you are to take on the work, get guidance on
re-prioritizing and ensure the request is documented in writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: If there's something you want to do, <strong>strive for
influence without authority</strong> instead of working to gain control
over resources (e.g., through promotion). Avoid the following: "In this
organization X is important to me, but I can't do X right now because I
don't have enough power in the organization. So I'll get promoted and
then do X."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Learn the perspectives of those around
you.</strong><br />
Learning the about the paradoxes of bureaucratic <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a> and <a
href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">unavoidable hazards</a> enables you to
talk with your fellow bureaucrats about these specific topics. The goal
is to find out what the other person is thinking so that you can account
for their view; the goal is not necessarily to find consensus or
agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Account for holistic view.</strong><br />
The specific circumstances of the challenges you face as a bureaucrat
depend on the individual people involved, what the purpose of the
bureaucracy is, what technology is available for enacting bureaucracy,
and the resources (staffing, money, time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Learn the history of the challenge.</strong><br />
This goes beyond <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton%23Chesterton&#39;s_fence">Chesterton's
fence</a>, which focuses on why the current approach is in place.
Learning the history of a problem (<span
data-acronym-label="decision archaeology"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">decision archaeology</span>) means
what has been tried before and failed. How did the previous iterations
evolve into the current situation? Was the cause personalities,
insufficient resources, inadequate technology? What's changed that
enables this approach to be better? What do you know that prior attempts
didn't?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>For a given challenge, work on three
remedies</strong>.<br />
One solution you're working on may fail, and another may be
inadequate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Minimize <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">imposing costs on other
people</a></strong>.<br />
A solution that externalizes costs harms the greater organization and
creates bureaucratic debt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Exploit the flexibility of rules for the benefit of
all parties.</strong><br />
Change the rules of the game and the objectives of the game such that
every participant wins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Find ways to rephrase negative
complaints</strong>.<br />
Negative observation: "Logging into my computer takes a long
time."<br />
Positive statement and explanation of impact: "If the latency for
logging into my computer were lower, I could make more progress on
X."</p>
<p>Negative observation: "The service team I need support from doesn't
offer a ticketing queue."<br />
Positive statement: "If the service team I need support from offered a
ticketing queue, I would be able to track the work done on my
behalf."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do</em>: <strong>Share lessons learned</strong>.<br />
This can build your network. People value vulnerability in others; you
can make the first move.</p>

<p>In this chapter the challenges of bureaucracy are described. There
are a lot of them. If at some point you become exasperated, then skip to
the next chapter (which is more positive). The purpose of this chapter
is to decrease your surprise when you encounter these challenges. Also,
there's value in recognizing that the challenges are generic to
bureaucracy and not specific to you, your team, or your
organization.</p>

but is meant to be read by bureaucrats who want to improve their <span

<p>&nbsp;<br />
When you have a positive experience engaging with bureaucracy, your
positive attribution is to the people involved. Or the ease of a
solution makes bureaucracy less visible and the solution seems obvious.
When you have a negative experience with bureaucracy, complaints are
about the incompetence of the people involved or the incomprehensibility
of the system. Don't these bureaucrats know how to do their job? Why
isn't the solution obvious? Why does this system not work for me? David
Graeber summarized this view&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2015_Graeber_regulation">(Graeber 2015)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Amongst working-class Americans, government is generally seen as
being made up of two sorts of people: 'politicians,' who are blustering
crooks and liars but can at least occasionally be voted out of office,
and 'bureaucrats,' who are condescending elitists almost impossible to
uproot."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scale of bureaucracy (the number of people in an organization)
and the processes of an organization can seem disproportionate to the
complexity of the task. Typically when you interact as a subject of
bureaucracy with a bureaucratic organization the artifacts are simple,
like a form to fill out. The simplicity of the artifact does not
correlate to the number of decisions made, the tracking of information,
or the precautions taken by the organization. All these aspects are
invisible to the subject because they are internal to the
organization.</p>
<p>As an example, consider when you go to the doctor and they put your
broken arm in a cast. That seems straightforward because all you see is
the doctor putting a cast on. You don't get insight into the decisions
they had to make. Why did they need 20 years of focused schooling to
carry out a process that took 15 minutes?</p>
<p>Judging bureaucracy by the artifact visible to the individual subject
undersells the complexity of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making">decision-making</a>
necessary to take action. The contingencies that you were not exposed to
because everything went well make the amount of investment from the
bureaucrat appear wasteful. Distinguishing essential bureaucracy from
accidental or malicious bureaucracy is difficult.</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you also lack the ability to
distinguish how much work is attributable to the bureaucrat generating
justifications for their actions (colloquially, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass">covering the
bureaucrat's ass</a>). These justifications are needed both within the
organization and potentially for external stakeholders. Each
bureaucrat's rationalization may not be reviewed, but it needs to be
available for review later.</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you typically can't distinguish when
work is caused by a bureaucrat's ill-informed decisions. Is the person
stupid, mistaken, or is there something you are not taking into account?
Sometimes the work is carried out by insufficiently trained bureaucrats,
but you don't get to know whether you're working with an experienced and
knowledgeable bureaucrat or a new untrained bureaucrat.</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you don't have visibility on the many
nuances of an organization. The internal power struggles and
organizational politics that depend on personalities, resources, and
competing prioritization are not clear to outsiders. The inconsistency
of an organization's policies may not be felt by bureaucrats in that
organization. Each bureaucrat may have a different opinion, resulting in
a lack of consistent guidance. There may be legacy policies in effect
that once were useful but no longer should be applied.</p>
<p>There is no transparency on either the input or output for subjects.
For input, forms ask for specific information (the "what") but do not
provide the why. Similarly for output, decisions are made but without
justification or reasoning provided. The subject has no input on who
gets to make the decisions, nor does the subject feel the decision-maker
represents them, nor is there any obligation of competence in the
decision-making. Bureaucracies typically have a monopoly on the shared
resource they administer, so there are few choices available to the
subject.</p>
<p>Effective action by a bureaucratic organization is complicated by the
need for relevant information. Gathering, analyzing, and sharing that
information persistently requires bureaucratic processes. To further
complicate the ideal process, sometimes the organization lacks
bureaucrats with relevant skills.</p>
<p>The next section documents why bureaucracy is hard from the
perspective of the bureaucrat. Even without getting into the specifics
of a bureaucrat's role or the purpose of an organization, there are
generic reasons that bureaucracy is a burdensome activity. Your <span
data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span> stems from
recognizing other bureaucrats face the same challenges that you
experience.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="identifying-opportunities-to-decide"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Identifying Opportunities to
Decide<span id="sec:dilemma-trilemma"
label="sec:dilemma-trilemma"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is the set of subjective decisions people make as part of
an effort to manage access to resources shared by a community.
Bureaucrats face a multitude of decisions independent of the specific
shared resource and independent of which organization the bureaucrat is
a member of. To build your process empathy, this section reviews
decisions every bureaucrat faces.</p>
<p>When a decision has two viable options (neither being best), that is
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma">dilemma</a>. The name
for a decision with three equally viable options is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma">trilemma</a>. This section
describes a bureaucrat's experience of operating within an organization
in terms of dilemmas and trilemmas. Instead of focusing on moral
dilemmas&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2017_Zacka">(Zacka
2017)</span> or institutional ethics, here the focus is on interpersonal
relationships and the logistics of allocating your attention.</p>
<p>Dilemmas are a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning">simple way</a>
of discussing decisions. Dilemmas are a useful framing to highlight the
following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You, an individual bureaucrat, face decisions that you may not
have recognized. Failing to recognize a choice (an error by omission<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>) can lead to suboptimal results.
The dilemmas below are generic to any bureaucratic process and are
intended to stimulate your ability to identify decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>You face complex trade-offs in your role as a bureaucrat.
Dilemmas are intended as an entry point to more nuanced reflection that
is specific to your situation. The dilemmas below are not exhaustive;
this list is merely illustrative. The list is intentionally long to
emphasize there are many dilemmas.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use dilemmas as an entry to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind">intellectual
empathy</a> with fellow bureaucrats when you recognize they face the
same dilemmas. The dilemmas presented here are generic to a variety of
situations. You now have a topic to discuss with other bureaucrats. You
can share your understanding, and you can be curious about the choice
other bureaucrats select for a given dilemma. Everyone in the
organization faces these decisions, so these dilemmas give you a topic
of conversation to better understand each bureaucrat's view.</p></li>
<li><p>When you encounter a bureaucratic process that does not feel
intuitive, you can try to understand which dilemmas the designers faced.
You can identify relevant dilemmas to build <span
data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can identify and negotiate potential sources of friction.
Other bureaucrats may arrive at different selections for a given
dilemma, so recognizing this and discussing it can improve the
effectiveness of all involved.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't recognize the existence of the dilemmas or name
them, bureaucracy can feel like resistance, confusion, conflict, and
frustration. By recognizing the dilemmas specific to your situation, you
can see that bureaucracy is a set of opportunities and potential
disagreements that can be negotiated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dilemmas explain the inherent complexity of bureaucracy even when
bureaucrats are honest and the purpose of the organization is clear.
However, the point isn't that one should <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">select one of the two
options</a>. The point of recognizing a dilemma is that it is a marker
that there is a decision to be made. Once the need for a decision is
identified, the effective bureaucrat identifies nuances, enumerates
alternatives, and talks with fellow bureaucrats about these decisions.
Rather than seeking consensus, strive for comprehension of other
people's perspectives. That way you can navigate decision-making
processes more effectively.</p>
<p>The choices described below in the simplified representation of
dilemmas are intended as a starting point for introducing the decisions
relevant to each bureaucrat. Once you recognize the need for a decision,
avoid the response of, "Should I do this or that?" If you limit the
opportunities you neglect nuances that enable more creative approaches.
By recognizing the deficiencies of dilemmas, you can identify nuances
specific to the situation you are in and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming">brainstorm</a>
multiple options.</p>
<p>Dilemmas should not be resolved by you alone. Talk with people you
manage, peers, mentors, customers, and managers. Understand the history
of the situation before making a choice and taking action.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-dilemmas-arise-in-bureaucracy">How
Dilemmas Arise in Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The existence of dilemmas is not obvious or natural. Given a task,
the simplest response for a person is to take action and be done. There
wasn't a decision needed.</p>
<p>If the task is more challenging then make a plan, take action, and be
done. The source of the challenge may be task complexity, scale, number
of people affected, diversity of stakeholders, amount of time needed,
how the current task shapes future options, or the number of
collaborators. Regardless of why the task is challenging, a dilemma has
already arisen: how much time to spend planning versus doing.</p>
<p>If the task is even more challenging, it may be useful to gather data
for the plan, then make a plan, then take action and be done. A new
dilemma arises: how much time to spend gathering data versus planning.
The previous dilemma still exists -- how much time to invest in planning
versus doing. As an alternative to the dilemma framing, how much time
should be allocated to three categories of activity?</p>
<p>But wait, how did the person in the first scenario (just do the task)
know no plan was necessary? Either it was an explicit choice or they
didn't perceive the need to plan -- deciding not to plan and not planning
are indistinguishable to anyone else. Someone else faced with that same
task might choose differently, e.g., to make a plan. The task complexity
is relative to the person's skills, experiences, expectations about
stakeholders, and potential ramifications.</p>
<p>To continue with this escalating sequence of increasingly challenging
tasks, now suppose the task involves you and another person. The
overhead of coordination inflicts new dilemmas. The examples of
complexity arising from coordination are identified in the list of
dilemmas below, e.g., Dilemmas <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-early-intervention"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-early-intervention">3.3</a> and
<a href="#table:dilemma-personal-manager-micromanaging"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-manager-micromanaging">3.4</a>.</p>
<p>An independent source of friction for distributed decision-making and
distributed knowledge is when people involved in the task don't agree on
how challenging it is. The framing of the difficulty matters because it
can lead different participants to distinct conclusions about how much
time should be spent planning versus doing. The choice of "How
complicated is the task?" shapes the team dynamics and informs the need
for hierarchical roles.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="folk-wisdom-on-decision-making">Folk Wisdom
on Decision-Making</h3>
<p>Bureaucrats, whether hired for their expertise or to provide labor,
are rarely experts in decision-making. There are multiple domains in
which <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">decision-making</a>
is studied (e.g., <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory">economics</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">mathematics</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making">psychology</a>),
but practicing bureaucrats are more likely familiar with colloquialisms
that feel descriptive. A few are provided here to give a sense of both
the conciseness (relevant for memetic propagation) and the lack of
prescriptive action in each meme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy's law</a>:
"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law">Hick's law</a>:
"Increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time
logarithmically."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon's
razor</a>: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained
by stupidity."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson's
law</a>: "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its
completion."<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Law of
Triviality</a>: "People within an organization commonly or typically
give disproportionate weight to trivial issues."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart's
law</a>: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good
measure."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Each of these memes feels descriptive to the practicing bureaucrat. They
survive because of their self-encapsulation; no more thought needed.
There is also nothing actionable about these memes.</p>
<p>In comparison to the folk expressions above, dilemmas are intended to
serve practicing bureaucrats as an accessible starting point for
reflection and discussion resulting in action. Effective action is
enabled by an improved understanding of the trade-offs faced within an
organization. Rather than being reductive, the purpose of cataloging
bureaucratic dilemmas is to first point out that there is a choice. Once
the choice is recognized, look for ways to think beyond the
dichotomy.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-dilemmas-oversimplify">How Dilemmas
Oversimplify</h3>
<p>Although the following concepts are presented as dilemmas and
trilemmas, these are necessarily simplifications. For example, two ways
to simplify situations into a dilemma are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with a single variable, e.g., "how much data to gather,"
and force it into a binary choice "more data gathering" versus "less
data gathering."</p></li>
<li><p>Start with a complex trade-off space with many opportunities and
reduce it to a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dichotomy</a>
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_thinking">zero-sum
options</a> where more of one means less of the other: "more data
gathering" versus "more planning." The trade-space involves optimization
of multiple goals, like maximizing productivity, minimizing unnecessary
risk, maximizing quality, maximizing employee satisfaction, and
minimizing latency.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The over-simplified dilemmas listed below neglect both the continuous
nature of the trade-offs and the alternative creative approaches to a
specific situation.</p>
<p>Framing decisions as dilemmas is an oversimplification, but they are
useful way to begin contemplating the complexity of bureaucracy. Rather
than waiting until the need for decision arises, ponder these dilemmas
before the pressure of live decision-making. In your work you can
recognize dilemmas and trilemmas and then extend your analysis beyond
them by adapting to the local conditions and specific people available
to help.</p>
<p>Once a dilemma is recognized, it can be tempting to defer and avoid
the decision-making process. <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Delaying a decision
negatively impacts the people awaiting action, so act quickly. Document
your reasoning in a way other stakeholders can discover.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="dilemmas-are-not-purely-intellectual">Dilemmas are not Purely
Intellectual</h3>
<p>Decision-making is not a purely intellectual task; there is emotional
stress induced by the process. Dilemmas create cognitive dissonance for
the decision-maker. Any selection is going to have downsides, and
compromise can be suboptimal. Those burdens weigh morally on deciders
because of the consequences on other people.</p>
<p>To counter this moral weight, talk with other people about decisions.
Even though this does not alleviate the responsibility of deciding,
discussion can help you arrive at new insights.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="more-complications">More Complications</h3>
<p>Adding to the difficulty and stress, dilemmas presented here occur
concurrently (at the same time) and continuously (all the time). The
dilemmas are interdependent due to both common variables and constrained
resources. Selecting an option for one dilemma alters the options
available for other dilemmas.</p>
<p>Oscillation between approaches can be caused by a change of
management, accumulation of experience (dissatisfaction) with one
solution, the desire for promotion within the hierarchy (where change is
presented as progress), or a desire for cost savings (efficiency).<a
href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The rate of oscillation is an
indicator of the half-life of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_memory">institutional
memory for an organization</a>.</p>
<p>The dilemmas identified below for generic bureaucracy are just a
baseline. There will be more dilemmas to identify that are specific to
the culture you are in, the project you're working on, and the people
you're working with.</p>
<p>The following sections categorize dilemmas as <a
href="#sec:personal-policy-dilemmas">personal policies</a>, policies
regarding <a href="#sec:org-dilemma">structure of the organization</a>,
and <a href="#sec:subjects-dilemmas">dilemmas raised by subjects of

organization, while the structural policies for an organization are
faced by a subset of bureaucrats in the management role.</p>

<p>In practice, the following decisions are unordered and are constantly
faced by the bureaucrat. As observed by Lindblom in&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="1959_Lindblom">(Lindblom 1959)</span>, this
flurry of decisions contrasts with a regularized process that you might

</div>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-focus-vs-systemic">Dilemma of
Aperture</a> is about the scope of the challenge. The <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-focus-vs-systemic">Dilemma of Aperture</a>
arises because isolated problems rarely exist. Challenges occur as part
of larger systemic contexts. Addressing the immediate problem leaves the
system issue, and tackling system issues is more difficult and takes
longer.</p>
<p>Your selection of narrow versus wide scope within the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-focus-vs-systemic">Dilemma of Aperture</a>
depends on what you find emotionally rewarding. Other bureaucrats may
gain emotional enjoyment from approaches to problem-solving that you do
not. Finding ways to leverage that difference (rather than minimizing
it) is useful.</p>
<p>An adjacent dilemma is the question of whether to focus on short-term
tasks or long-term tasks. The right balance of how long tasks take is
more project management than bureaucratic. Identify a small number of
long-term tasks, then divide each into smaller (shorter) tasks. The
dependencies among the smaller tasks then determine the order of the
work.</p>
<p>Organizations typically incentivize short-term behavior. Annual
performance reviews and quarterly feedback cycles might miss systemic
changes that take multiple years to enact. Identifying incremental
milestones is one response, though that isn't always feasible. Another
approach is to only report a subset of your activities (the ones that
yield short-term results).</p>

<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-speak-up-or-hold-back">Dilemma

different opinions about policy. You may see someone doing something
that appears wasteful, but that may be because you're not aware of what
the optimization objective is. Or that person may be unaware of the
waste, or they may not be aware there is a more effective way to take
action.</p>
<p>Resolving differences of opinion is not always necessary. If all

the members could spend all of their time doing so.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-speak-up-or-hold-back">Dilemma

<p>Whether the culture of an organization promotes speaking up or not

<p>Bureaucracy is based on subjective decision-making about policy
enforcement. The <a

Documentation</a> is a question of whether you avoid the risk of
accountability or enable accountability of yourself and other

<p>If you decide to respond to the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-notes-or-no-notes">Dilemma of

<p>A limiting factor biasing a bureaucrat towards the "no documentation"
extreme is the ability to take good notes during or after conversations.
That can be limited by your ability to multi-task (listen and write),
your memory of what was said, or your handwriting. Another bottleneck is
the time needed for writing notes.</p>
<p>A standard response to the idea of taking notes is, "I remember what

<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-forest-vs-trees">Dilemma of

<p>Coordinating with other bureaucrats magnifies the challenge. If

<p>When you first hear of a challenge, you may be interested in
immediately tackling it. You see a path to improvement, you have the
skills needed, and addressing the challenge would help your team.
Unbeknownst to you, another person on another team saw that same
challenge and had the same reaction.</p>
<p>Because of the distributed nature of knowledge and decision-making in
bureaucracy, the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-meetings-versus-work">Dilemma of

subjective decisions being made. Advertising "I'm going to do
something," "I'm doing something," and "I did something" as you are

<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-bad-news-up-the-chain">Dilemma

organizations. Regardless of whether the hierarchy stems from the
specialization of skills or the delegation of decisions, information
traverses up the <a

command</a>.</p>
<p>News going up the chain of command is subject to modifications -- both
filtering and embellishment. Filtering out bad news or making the report
more grandiose can be spun as contextualization. Which outcome is
preferred depends on the specific people reading the reports. Whether to
report an update is one choice, how to spin it is another. Did the team
members fail to accomplish their objective, or did the team members
learn something that will inform the next phase of their progress?</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-bad-news-up-the-chain">Dilemma

<p>Managing shared resources in a dynamic environment necessitates
changes to policies and processes. Change, whether incremental or

current practices.</p>
<p>Incremental change provides quicker feedback but requires
understanding and integrating with the existing bureaucracy.
Revolutionary change is easier to get started but you will have to
relearn the lessons the incumbent already knows.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-disruptive-or-iterative">Dilemma

to change demoralizes the bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Being an innovator (whether incremental or disruptive) can gain you
supporters and friends as well as more negative reactions -- what does
that person think they are doing? That person is so na&#xEF;ve.</p>
<p>A good indicator that you're on a useful path is when your support is
from people with less to lose (at the bottom of the organization's
hierarchy) and when the resistance is from people who have more status

<p>Decision-making is foundational to bureaucracy, so gathering data to
inform decisions is crucial. There's typically insufficient time and
resources available for this work, which results in imperfect
decisions.</p>
<p>The <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-gather-data-lots-vs-little">Dilemma of
Data Quantity</a> is more nuanced than merely finding <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle">just the right
amount</a> of data. The skill is knowing which data is most relevant to
the decision and having relationships with data owners to ease the cost
of gathering data.</p>
<p>The logistics of gathering data can be measured, but there are other
subjective aspects to account for as well. Making a decision has an
emotional toll on the decider due to the risk of failure. Also,
decisions are made in a social context, with decision-makers accounting
for the ramifications on people they have relationships with.</p>
<p>While gathering less data means less cost for the bureaucrat facing a
decision, you might imagine some accountability for bad decisions due to
inadequate data. To shield individual bureaucrats from
reputation-harming liability, a decision may require an approval chain.
That review process diffuses responsibility for decisions.</p>

<p>Making a decision imposes a bound on how much time is available for
both gathering data and planning. More time gathering data is less time

<p>Framed as "Should you work on something consequential?" the na&#xEF;ve

<p>Bureaucracy involves coordination to facilitate distributed knowledge

email, video), there is often more information to be consumed. The <a

<p>A bureaucratic organization responsible for management of shared
resources has finite staffing and money. When there are multiple
concurrent efforts relevant to managing the shared resource, dividing
staffing and money is a challenge.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-personal-cooperate-vs-compete">Dilemma of
Cooperate or Compete</a> is best addressed through explicit
conversations, both between peers and with decision-makers. These
discussions may not remedy the challenge, but they provide an

appreciation for possible outcomes.</p>

<p>The best approach to the dilemma of whether to specialize or
generalize is to aim to be "T" shaped -- breadth and some depth.</p>
<p>As a specialist, you have two choices: invest in deepening your
expertise and skills, or expand the breadth of integration with your
team members. Both have the result of improving your organization, but
they are not equivalent in impact. Educating your coworkers and

<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-org-inhouse-vs-external">Dilemma of

market and to governments in a global environment. Externalized services
may be cheaper, but the long-term consequence is the loss of in-house
expertise.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats making decisions about shared resources benefit from
personal experience gained from working on specific challenges. When
services are outsourced, oversight doesn't provide insight into the
nuances of the issue.</p>
<p>Teams in a bureaucratic organization that work on aspects not

<p>Bureaucratic organizations are comprised of teams that provide
services to other members of the organization and to subjects. A
centralized approach improves efficiency through less redundancy, but
also can decrease responsiveness. Grove&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1995_Grove">(Grove 1995)</span> calls the centralized model
functional teams.</p>
<p>Centralization is often carried out for cost efficiency. The cost
savings are due to de-duplication and having less slack. Both of those
"savings" are a decrease of redundancy, which has a cost when there are
unexpected fluctuations in need.</p>
<p>Another motive for centralization is to concentrate talent within the
organization. This can have the unintentional result of siloing talent
and isolating experts from the people they want to help.</p>
<p>Decentralized manifests as cross-functional teams. Do the compliance
officers, financial people, or IT support staff work directly on your
team locally or are they in a separate team?</p>
<p>The rate of change between centralized and decentralized may be a
function of turnover or promotion rates.</p>
<p>A matrixed organization&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1985_NASA">(Mulligan 1985)</span> mixes the centralized
approach and cross-functional team.</p>
<p>Centralization is an intentional monopolization, with a corresponding
decrease in choices. Centralization (de-localization) can decrease the
value assigned to feedback from people using the service because
personal relations are devalued.</p>
<p>The weaker feedback, lack of redundancy, and decreased emphasis on
relationships motivate the creation of local services.</p>

someone else with different needs will want a different solution.</p>
<p>The default direction for a bureaucratic organization is toward
centralization and monopoly because that seems more efficient. At the
same time, individual bureaucrats observe local challenges and invent
solutions relevant to their needs.</p>

<p>Bureaucrats with direct exposure to a challenge and the ramifications
are better positioned to make decisions. As Marquet&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="2013_Marquet">(Marquet 2013)</span> points
out, pushing decisions down improves the sense of ownership. However,
people directly working on a challenge may lack a holistic perspective
held by bureaucrats higher in the chain of command.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-org-decisions-low-vs-high">Dilemma of
Decision Height</a> indicates that no one person is ideally positioned
to make decisions. Bureaucracy involves distributed decision-making
because no member has all the relevant information. The coordination of
distributed knowledge is a remedy that requires ongoing investment.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-org-decisions-low-vs-high">Dilemma of
Decision height</a> indicates that relationships up and down the chain
of command are necessary. Low-level bureaucrats need to understand the
holistic perspective, and bureaucrats at the top of the organization
need to understand the ramifications of their decisions.</p>
<p>Relationships rarely span the chain of command, and bureaucrats make
decisions based on locally accessible information and personal
experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Trilemma</em>: <strong>Do you support the cutting edge, most of the
middle, or the laggards?</strong><br />
For any given aspect of bureaucracy there is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">bell curve</a>
of skills and interests of bureaucrats. In your role as a bureaucrat you
face a choice: find and collaborate with and enable the best and
brightest, or aim your efforts at the massive mediocre middle (most
bureaucrats), or try to get the dumbest bureaucrats up to speed?</p>
<p>Trying to escape the trilemma by claiming that you treat everyone
equally means you are disregarding the needs of the tail of the
distribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Trilemma</em>: <strong>Do you work for your team, your manager, or
yourself?</strong><br />
Being a member of a team that operates within a hierarchy is tough. One
reason is the question of who you are working for. The trilemma is
whether you work for yourself, work for your manager, or work for your
team. Ideally, you can find ways to do all three, but that is not always
the case.</p>
<p>Members of the team should work collaboratively, but there is a
potential counter-force: accountability to the manager. Because each
team member is accountable to their manager(s), that motivates the
action of the individual. The team does not have autonomy -- they are
accountable to the boss.</p>
<p>In the approach "team members are directed by their manager," the
synergy of the team is neglected and the manager becomes a bottleneck
(for decision-making and for creativity and for planning).</p>
<p>The third approach is for a person to ignore their team and their
manager. This might enable quicker progress, at the risk of going in an
unhelpful direction or not leveraging the skills of coworkers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Trilemma</em>: <strong>Seek less budget, same, or larger
budget.</strong> Less budget is needed if you improve efficiency, but
then the proportional power within the organization is decreased. A
larger budget may be due to inefficiency or growth. Keeping the same
budget indicates no promotions are relevant (although a steady state
could result from a combination of growth and improved efficiency).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A trilemma applicable to many situations is that options are
<strong>fast, inexpensive, good; choose two</strong>. (This is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">project
management triangle</a>.)<br />
In other words, the options are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Good and fast is expensive (i.e., requires lots of
resources).</p></li>
<li><p>Good and inexpensive takes a long time (i.e., find a clever
solution).</p></li>
<li><p>Fast and inexpensive will be low quality.</p></li>

<p>The origin of the <a

<p>Bureaucrats seek consistency in the application of policies as a
defensible story justifying the allocation of shared resources. A
complicating factor is whether you think of fairness as equality
(consistency means everything is the same) or equity (consistency
accounts for differences).</p>
<p>As with the <a href="#table:dilemma-subject-forms">Dilemma of

<p>The application of policy by bureaucrats is subjective. Relying on

Predictability of rulings helps bureaucrats and subjects.</p>
<p>As with all other dilemmas, the <a

<p>The bias for bureaucrats faced with the <a

</div>
<p>Whenever there is a desire for lower cost and some feature, there is
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest">conflict
of interest</a> with the costly feature. Bureaucrats make subjective
decisions, so transparency helps other people understand the reasoning
behind outcomes. Transparency is not free, so a dilemma occurs.</p>
<p>The <a href="#table:dilemma-subject-transparency">Dilemma of
Transparency</a> depends on your role. If you are a decision-maker or
data owner, you do not gain immediate value from justifying decisions or
sharing data. You pay a cost to provide transparency, both reputational
(your mistakes become visible) and financial (for hosting data, time
spent publishing). There are potential benefits to transparency --
improved trust in relationships, subjects detecting and reporting
mistakes.</p>
<p>An incumbent bureaucrat defaults to no transparency. If subjects want
to dispute decisions they benefit from having information about how the
policy was applied. If the subject is willing to pay the cost for the
data, then the decision-maker has to do extra work to make data
available.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="consequences-of-the-dilemma-based-framing">Consequences of the
Dilemma-based Framing</h4>
<p>There are many dilemmas listed above but the list is not
comprehensive. The point of having a detailed list rather than just a
few is to illustrate the nuance and complexity of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>In practice, most bureaucrats do not choose an optimization strategy,
then decide how to respond to all 60+ dilemmas. Nor do bureaucrats talk
with their fellow bureaucrats about how to respond as an organization to
all 60 dilemmas. Bureaucrats decide when forced to respond by
circumstances after having deferred as long as possible. Early decisions
are premature and have less information.</p>
<p>Decisions regarding how to respond to a dilemma are not made in
isolation - one decision alters the options available for other
dilemmas. The ability to project potential consequences depends on you
understanding the reaction of peers, people you manage, and managers you
depend on. Your decisions create constraints and opportunities for
them.</p>
<p>A bureaucrat aiming to avoid dilemmas may respond by deferring to
someone higher in the hierarchy to decide and coordinate. While fewer
people making decisions would improve consistency, this would be <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement">micromanagement</a>.
The people in the hierarchy above the person facing the choice don't
have exposure to the problem. Choices are delegated to leverage
expertise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
When you are facing these dilemmas and trilemmas there are constructive
responses that can improve your effectiveness. Improvement helps your
results, your reputation, and the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collect quantitative data for each variable. Quantitative
arguments can augment qualitative stories.</p></li>
<li><p>Construct the Pareto frontier to identify non-optimal choices
that can be eliminated.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of assessing variables in isolation, assess consequences
in the context of workflows and effects on stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss subjective decisions with stakeholders so that potential
disagreements can be negotiated instead of creating friction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Even if each bureaucrat were to consider the same dilemmas (which
doesn't necessarily happen), not everyone makes the same selection. This
is a source of friction in an organization. The next section expands on
the challenges inherent to bureaucracy.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="unavoidable-hazards-of-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Unavoidable Hazards of
Bureaucracy<span id="sec:unavoidable-hazards"
label="sec:unavoidable-hazards"></span></h2>
<p>There are certain challenges in a bureaucracy that cannot be avoided.
The value of recognizing them is to understand that what you're
experiencing isn't an anomaly. The problem isn't unique to you, your
circumstances, your coworkers, or the organization. The cause is the
combination of all those factors. Understanding the unavoidable hazards
in a bureaucratic organization improves your Process Empathy.</p>
<p>Accounting for unavoidable hazards is what distinguishes being na&#xEF;ve
from having experience. A na&#xEF;ve bureaucrat may see a challenge and come
up with an idea of how to improve the situation. In practice, merely
having a good idea is insufficient for improvement; the availability of
a good idea is not enough for adoption or continuation if there are
incentives for stakeholders contrary to the idea.</p>
<p>Even when a good idea is adopted that does not imply longevity. The
idea may only be enacted for a promotion, or while the champion
persists. Concepts that improve a team or organization do not need to
continue.</p>
<p>Being aware of the unavoidable hazards is vital to your tenacity as a
bureaucrat. Your emotional fortitude is critical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Separation of responsibility and
accountability</strong>.<br />
Each bureaucrat in an organization has responsibilities associated with
their role. The ability to complete the tasks associated with the role
is not wholly within the scope of the bureaucrat's control. You are
dependent on other bureaucrats. Even if there is a desire for action,
the action might not be immediately feasible because of a dependence on
another person or process.</p>
<p>The consequence of separating responsibility from authority is that
other people look incompetent or lazy and unresponsive. For the same
reasons, you feel impotent. In this scenario Process Empathy can take
two forms: empathizing with fellow bureaucrats who are in this state, or
intentionally exceeding the boundaries of your role to break the
equilibrium.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Perception matters more than
intent</strong>.<br />
You may mean to convey a specific message, but the way your listeners
hear that content or read the message depends on context and
interpretation. Decreasing the ambiguity in phrasing is a useful
investment, but you don't control how an audience responds.</p>
<p>Communication is crucial for bureaucracy, so the best response is
iterating with an audience rather than expecting a single message to be
enough.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Appreciation for being an effective
bureaucrat is rare.</strong><br />
If you do your job well no one will notice. This is because of an
expectation of smooth and fast interactions. Frictionless engagement is
expected even if that is not the norm.</p>
<p>Consider teachers who catch cheating students&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2022_unknown">(unknown, n.d.)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No one [thanks teachers] for policing cheating. Not the cheaters,
not the honest students who feel inconvenienced and mistrusted, and
certainly not the school [administrators] who have to process academic
dishonesty paperwork."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This same concept applies to any bureaucrat. The number of thank you
cards sent to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug
Administration</a> meat inspectors keeping food safe, <a
href="https://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Safety and Health
Administration</a> regulators ensuring a safe work environment, <a
href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a>
detecting disruptive electromagnetic signals, <a
href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a>, and <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> is
likely small.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>There are counterexamples in public service bureaucracy. Law
enforcement is thanked when there is a victim of a crime. The military
is held in high regard. In both of those bureaucracies the bureaucrats
are visible and the consequence of their work is tangible.</p>
<p>In large organizations there are teams of bureaucrats like the
Information technology department and human resources. IT support
bureaucrats are occasionally thanked by their subjects, though most of
the time the expectation is that computers should just work. Outside of
hiring, HR produces few tangible products, so the appreciation is
lower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Lack of accountability to fellow bureaucrats
who rely on you.</strong><br />
You are more likely to feel accountable to your supervisor. Performing
for your supervisor and explaining your value matters more than the work
done to support coworkers. This also applies when you depend on other
people -- they aren't accountable to you.</p>
<p>To counter this tendency, build personal relationships with peers.
This requires ongoing investment, both to maintain relationships and to
create bonds with new coworkers as your previous coworkers leave.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Decision-makers are under-informed and
inexperienced.</strong><br />
You can make a decision with insufficient information. There is rarely
an expectation of expertise or experience. Gathering information takes
time and is thus burdensome. Having experience requires getting
experience -- you either start as a novice and make mistakes, have formal
academic training, or rely on mentorship to avoid the direct experience
of mistakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Gathering data for decisions takes resources
and expertise.</strong><br />
When there is a desire to gather data, and there is data available to be
gathered, an investment of time is necessary. Well-informed decisions
take time, experience, or both.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Defining success is subjective and
dynamic</strong>.<br />
Who defines success and for which audience in a bureaucratic
organization is subjective because of the lack of feedback mechanisms.
Consequences may not be immediately obvious. Worse, how success is
defined can be changed at any time -- there's no need for
consistency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Change threatens incumbents</strong>.<br />
For example, change of plans, roles, tasks, resources, the flatness of
the organization, scope, or technology.</p>
</div>
<p>Practicing Process Empathy means having compassion towards the fear
other people fear and socializing the change before enacting change.

<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility">Diffusion
of responsibility</a> in the bureaucracy</strong>.<br />
A specific task needs to be completed, and action requires the
involvement of multiple collaborators. In this scenario there's a risk
of each <span data-acronym-label="participant"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">participant</span> not feeling
ownership over the outcome. This risk is more likely when roles are less
well-defined or when participants don't have relationships to
maintain.</p>
</div>
<p>Consider the perspectives of an office worker, an office manager, a
building manager, an electrical substation operator, and an electrical
grid operator.</p>
<div class="center">

style="width:70.0%" />
<figcaption>Toaster oven in the office kitchen. Each participant in the
accounting process adds overhead to the baseline.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>An office worker wants to plug in a toaster oven in the office
kitchen (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:toaster_oven"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:toaster_oven">3.5</a>).
The owner of the toaster oven files a notice with the office manager who
tracks electrical loads in the kitchen. The toaster owner uses the power
number (1200 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt">Watts</a>)
from the manufacturer's website. In practice, the toaster oven doesn't
use that much power; that's just the maximum rating for the device.</p>
<p>The office manager aggregates power from the devices in the kitchen.
The office manager has a power budget for the team's kitchen equipment
and keeps a margin of 10% spare capacity for flexibility. The office
manager's power budget is provided to the building manager (who keeps a
margin of 10% for flexibility). The building is one of many sharing the
electrical substation. The electrical substation owner sees the power
consumption is below the rated capacity, but the subscription for
available power is full -- no new users can be supported.</p>
</div>
<p>Lesson: in a system of aggregated layers, each person only sees
adjacent layers. When each person builds safety into their budget, the
accumulated slack is excessive and wasteful.</p>
<p>Similar situations arise for temporal planning (schedule), financial
budgets, and spatial planning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Diffusion of blame in the
bureaucracy</strong>.<br />
Example: if something goes wrong, who is at fault: the creator of a
policy or the person tasked with executing the policy?</p>
<p>To apply your Process Empathy redirect the focus from blaming people
to identifying systemic causes. Did the people involved have enough
training? Was adequate time allocated for the task? Were people
distracted, tired, or hungry?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Management doesn't do their job
well</strong>.<br />
From your perspective as a bureaucrat (or subject), management may seem
inadequate. The Peter Principle&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1970_Peter">(Peter 1970)</span>, the Dilbert Principle&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="1997_Adams">(Adams 1997)</span>, and the
Gervais Principle&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2009_Rao">(Rao
2009)</span> all attempt to explain this feature. Process Empathy
provides another perspective.</p>
<p>Management may oversee multiple different disciplines (e.g.,
engineering, marketing, manufacturing) and different types of people
(e.g., outgoing, introverted, independent) and as a result have
insufficient time to address everyone's needs.</p>
<p>Management is supposed to facilitate coordination in the hierarchy
between teams. Management often lacks technical expertise and lacks time
needed to understand each issue deeply. Management adds latency to the
process of coordination. The alternative, not including management in
coordination and instead relying on direct interaction between peers, is
chaotic.</p>
<p>Manage is supposed to coordinate up, down, and laterally. Each of
those is supposed to be bidirectional.</p>
<p>Management is supposed to make decisions that affect multiple
different teams but lacks expertise and the time to understand each
issue in-depth.</p>
<p>Management has a holistic perspective to identify gaps and
inefficiencies. Management has the authority to redirect resources to
address these issues.</p>
<p>The choice of the manager is to either dive deeply into one topic
(and neglect the other needs) or try and superficially respond to all
needs and seem like a dilettante. Because management cannot address
issues satisfactorily, they appear incompetent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Policies are dumb</strong>.<br />
There are a variety of reasons for this, but a sampling of the causes
includes incompetence, diffused control, and what is valued.</p>
<p>Incompetence as a source of dumb policies arises for multiple
reasons, but a subtle cause for individuals making bad decisions is that
information isn't available.</p>
<p>As another cause for dumb policies, sometimes the information exists
and relevant decisions are identified but control is spread across the
organization resulting in lack of coordination. This is a coordination
issue.</p>
<p>In some organizations adding complexity is perceived as a source of
value. This is because nuance (appropriate to a situation) gets
confounded with complexity.</p>
<p>Dumb policies arise when the conventional process is story-driven
requirements (as opposed to experimental data).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>High latency feedback</strong>.<br />
See <a href="#sec:slowing-communication">slow communication</a> and <a
href="#sec:decision-delay">decision delay</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Weak feedback</strong>.<br />
Suppose my bureaucratic task depends on a service provided by you, a
fellow bureaucrat. If your computer isn't working, your ability to
provide the service is blocked by a dependency on a computer repair
person. You might feel relieved -- you can relax while you wait on the
computer repair and you don't have to do work providing the service to
me. You might feel anxious -- you're unable to provide the service until
the computer is fixed. Regardless of how you feel about the situation,
my task is blocked. If neither you nor I have priority relative to the
computer repair person's other tasks, then we wait. This question of
priority could be resolved hierarchically (for which there is limited
attention bandwidth) or socially (dependent on someone having a
relationship with the repair person).</p>
<p>The delay for my task may be sufficiently small that raising the
issue through the hierarchy or socially is not a good use of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The person making the rules that you follow
doesn't know what they're doing</strong>.<br />
Your choices then include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Follow the rules that are not correct. This harms your
productivity and morale.</p></li>
<li><p>You can violate the rules and be more effective. This puts you at
risk for sanctions.</p></li>
<li><p>You can work the change the rules. Then you are not doing the
work that's needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>You rarely get to pick who is on the
team</strong>.<br />
When a task requires collaboration, there is rarely a choice of who you
get to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>You rarely get to alter team
membership.</strong><br />
As a team member, you typically get little input on who you work with.
Even as a manager your options for hiring are often limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Fear of the unknown.</strong><br />
Current suffering is tolerable compared to the uncertainty of change,
especially when the suffering isn't felt by the decision-maker.</p>
<p>By identifying this fear in yourself or those you collaborate with,
you can discuss specific concerns and work to address them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Fear of change.</strong><br />
Change disrupts the status quo, putting accumulated power at risk and
altering relationships.</p>
</div>
<p>An emotional basis for decision-making (or avoidance of
decision-making) may or may not be rational. Discussing the fear with
fellow bureaucrats can ease the burden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Fear of conflict.</strong><br />
Refers to conflict of ideas, not physical conflict. Conflict of ideas is
not personal, though the consequences may have impacts on careers for
stakeholders.<br />
Professional disagreement is to be expected in a bureaucratic
organization.</p>
<p>Feeling uncomfortable is distinct from feeling unsafe. Communicating
while feeling discomfort is a useful skill, rather than avoidance. You
can show courage by talking about your sense of discomfort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Inadequate resources: staffing, time,
money.</strong><br />
The resources you have to address a challenge may not match the
complexity of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Outcomes for the team are ill-defined and
constantly shifting.</strong><br />
Most bureaucrats rely on approaches that assume consistency of their
environment. Planning for uncertainty and change is more
complicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The reward for good work is more
work.</strong><br />
When a coworker doesn't do their fair share, then the productive
employee shoulders more burden. The deficient worker has no incentive to
improve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The organization has a lack of vision; or has
vision but no plan; or has vision and a plan but no consensus; or has
vision and a plan and consensus but inadequate resources.</strong><br />
An organization of bureaucrats can operate without a vision, plan, or
sufficient resources. Being busy is easy; being productive is hard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Progress depends on subjective
decision-making.</strong><br />
Rarely is the optimal path deterministic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Easier to ask for big money than small
money.</strong><br />
Processes are scale invariant. Regardless of whether you're asking for
$1000 or $100,000, the process is the same. Accountability processes for
large amounts of money are not scaled down to fit small amounts because
people can be as dumb with $100 as they are with $10,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Some challenges are scale
invariant</strong>.<br />
Challenges arising from personalities are invariant to where in the
hierarchy the problem occurs. The difference is that less attention is
paid to the same problem at the lowest levels as compared to higher in
the hierarchy because of the scope of impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Flux of people and processes.</strong><br />
Sources of flux include staff turnover, changing conditions, changing
timelines, change of vision, and the need to be promoted. Consistency
doesn't yield promotion in a bureaucracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Why are there so many rules?</strong><br />
To address edge cases and malicious or dumb people. See the <a
href="#table:dilemma-subject-forms">Dilemma of Forms</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>So much paperwork or forms.</strong> Why is red
tape endemic to bureaucracy?<br />
Paperwork as a form of coordination in processes to facilitate
decentralized decision-making.</p>
<p>One of the motives for paperwork is to catch people who are
misrepresenting their intent, whether accidental or intentional.
Documentation makes prosecution more straightforward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Everything is slower.</strong><br />
What the person saying this means is "slower than desired for what I
need" or "slower than I imagined in my simplified model."</p>
<p>Progress is slower than expected because there aren't as many hours
available as na&#xEF;vely imagined. The time spent working in a bureaucracy
is less than the number of hours you get paid for. Breaks taken during
work, vacation from work, holidays, and sick leave are illustrated in
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:hours_per_year" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:hours_per_year">3.6</a>. An added factor is that the
people you depend on do not work exclusively on your request -- there are
competing investments of attention.</p>
<p>Developing <span data-acronym-label="process empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process empathy</span> means having a
more detailed model that accounts for the cost of coordination and
accounts for there being less time available than the na&#xEF;ve
expectation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy grows.</strong><br />
Increasing the size of a bureaucracy is easier than cutting it down. The
causes of growth include scope creep, an increased number of people
participating in the process, an increased workload, or a decrease of
the ratio of workers to managers.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy grows because some people lie -- there are defectors.
Progress is called "improved accountability" because we aren't sure who
the next liar is going to be. More work is created for everyone because
confronting liars and cheaters is uncomfortable and takes work.</p>
<p>You can measure the growth of bureaucracy using metrics like the
latency in addressing a request and the number of people involved in
addressing a request.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing the size of a bureaucracy is easier than cutting
it down.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>The ratio of workers to managers gets worse as
the size of the hierarchy grows</strong>.<br />
As complexity and workload increase, the number of staff needed
increases. To facilitate coordination, managers arise. The amount of
work being done in a bureaucracy can be small compared to the number of
participants.</p>
<p>In Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:growth_of_bureaucracy"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:growth_of_bureaucracy">3.7</a>a, the ratio of
workers to participants is 3:3=1. When a manager is added, the ratio is
3:4 = 0.75 (a lower value means less work per employee is being done).
Adding a second team with dedicated management puts the ratio at
6:9=0.66. Finally, with a dedicated administrative team (e.g., payroll,
hiring, facilities), the ratio is 6:13=0.46.</p>
<p>Adding more people to a hierarchical organization results in
diminishing returns for time spent on the central work since bureaucrats
invest time maintaining the hierarchy and administrative processes.</p>

<figcaption>As the depth of a hierarchical organization increases, the

</figure>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Each person in a bureaucracy has multiple
roles</strong>.<br />
To limit the expansion of the bureaucracy. The multiple roles come from
multiple relationships necessary to span an organization larger than <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar's
number</a> -- about 150 people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Everything is more
complicated</strong>.<br />
Bureaucracy administers access to resources, whether tangible items
(water, air) or expertise. There's friction for tangible resources
because the easiest solution is you get the resource (without an
intermediary). There's friction for expertise because the expert
understands things you do not.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is inefficient and
wasteful.</strong><br />
The inefficiency of an organization is not just due to a breakdown of
communication among its many members. Other sources include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Individuals in different roles face distinct external incentives
that drive a diversity of investments. Work that is not aligned results
in wasted effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants have different views of what constitutes a problem
and which problem is most relevant. Coordinating to resolve
disagreements appears inefficient regardless of which metric is used to
measure efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>Within the organization there can be competition for resources.
Competition leads to wasted effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Because decisions by bureaucrats are subjective, there is
significant risk of being wrong or being called out by others as being
wrong. The incentive to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass">cover your ass</a><a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> exists for decisions. As a result,
unnecessary work is carried out to limit blame.</p></li>
<li><p>Situations and constraints change faster than the time it takes
to complete a task. Then you are faced with either continuing under the
initial assumptions or pivoting a project partway through. If an
objective quantitative measure of value is available, the return on
investment could be determined.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Efficiency is typically assessed from the perspective of a serial
process -- a single worker could do this task faster, so why involve ten
people and get a slower, more burdensome result? Specialization of
skills, resilience, validation checks, and increased throughput all
motivate the addition of bureaucrats to processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Brook's</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month"><em>Mythical
Man-Month</em></a>&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1975_brooks">(Brooks 1975)</span> points out that dividing a
task among ten people does not make the task finish in a tenth of the
time. There is overhead of coordination and the training of new members
who are intended to help.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's
law</a> is the quantification that a task that takes one person one hour
is unlikely to scale to ten people accomplishing ten results in one
hour. The consequence is that you can't evaluate what should be
considered wasteful by considering a single person's throughput and then
multiplying by the number of people on a team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Scope creep.</strong><span
id="sec:scope-creep" label="sec:scope-creep"></span><br />
Scope creep can originate from three sources: the bureaucrat doing the
work, the subject of the bureaucrat's work, and the bureaucrat's
management. In the first situation, the person doing the work might see
a nearby opportunity that only requires a little more work.</p>
</div>
<p>When the subject is the source of scope creep, the root cause is that
the subject wants more. While the exploration of what's possible can be
exciting (a positive experience), what the bureaucrat hears is more work
and delayed results. This implies a few trade-off options, all of which
are negative for one or both parties.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stick with the original terms (telling the subject "no", which is
negative for both parties).</p></li>
<li><p>Re-negotiation for more time (a burden to both parties).</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat doing more for the same pay, which means less
money per effort (yielding a less happy bureaucrat).</p></li>
<li><p>Decreasing existing efforts to fit the added requirements
(yielding a less happy subject).</p></li>
<li><p>Even if the bureaucrat is getting paid by the hour, more work
means the end product will be delayed to accommodate added features
(yielding a less happy subject).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The third source of scope creep is management. Executive
decision-makers tried to make decisions without having the full context
of the impacts of the decisions. People lower in the hierarchy see
opportunities and extend their scope incorrectly because they don't have
the full picture. In both these cases, the problem is that the person
doesn't know what they don't know and trying to solve problems outside
of their domain of responsibility. How would that person know that they
don't know? The easy answer to this is if you are in a position of
authority, check downward before making a pronouncement. If you are in a
position of execution, check upward before taking action. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_(military)%23Commander&#39;s_intent">Commander's
intent</a> (the sharing of what the end-state should look like) works in
both directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Hazard</em>: <strong>Migrating technologies.</strong><br />
The person enacting the transition has to be educated in both the old
and new technology. The legacy code has to be migrated to the new
implementation convincing stakeholders; may require synchronization
difficulty scales with the number of stakeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The 39 hazards listed above are not comprehensive. However, there are
enough to illustrate that even a well-run organization with trained
bureaucrats trying to do good will encounter friction.</p>
<p>Even with the known hazards described above, you can be an effective
bureaucrat by practicing process empathy. The next chapter focuses on
what you can do.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="you-are-an-individual-in-an-organization"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> You are an Individual in an
Organization<span id="sec:individual-in-org"

<p><span>Back to the <a href="#sec:toc">Main Table of
Contents</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on the perspective of an individual bureaucrat
operating within an organization. What actions can you take? This
chapter is foundational to the next chapter which describes <a
href="#sec:working-with-other-bureaucrats">collaborating with
others</a>.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat, understanding your options for action matters.
You're less effective if you don't know what your options are. If you
are okay with being ineffective or are not feeling the harm of your
ineffectiveness, keep in mind that there is no neutral member of a
bureaucracy. Either you are contributing to the organization, or you are
sapping resources from the organization. This dichotomy exists because
the organization has a zero-sum allocation of resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
This chapter starts with the hiring and onboarding process, then focuses
on your emotional state as a bureaucrat, and ends with how you can be
effective. Even though you may join an organization once, organizations
that are not shrinking have to add new members due to turnover and
sometimes growing size. Even with this ingest of new people an
organization is distinct from the rest of society due to the differences
in norms and goals. If an organization does not invest in onboarding new
members, the norms of broader society will prevail. Littering, crime,
pollution, scams, and fraud are usually aspects organizations try to
constrain.</p>
<p>The next section on <a href="#sec:hiring">hiring</a> is discussed
from both the perspective of the person hiring and the person being
hired. Likewise, incentives for <a href="#sec:promotion">promotion</a>
are described from the view of the person promoting a bureaucrat and the
person seeking promotion. The reason to cover both roles is to help
people in each position build empathy with the other person's
experience.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="hiring-into-a-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Hiring into a Bureaucracy<span
id="sec:hiring" label="sec:hiring"></span></h2>
<p>Hiring shapes the culture of an organization and determines what is
feasible, both by the skills of those hired and how well new hires
integrate with the existing organization.</p>
<p>Hiring can be an expensive process, both in time and money spent by
the organization to recruit and filter applicants, as well as the
emotional investment of candidates. As a candidate, recognize the risk
the organization is taking. As a reviewer of candidates, hiring is an
investment in the future of the organization.</p>
<p>Organizations are not identical to the society they operate within.
As a candidate you should expect a different set of norms. As a
bureaucrat reviewing applicants you will see behaviors not consistent
with the norms of your organization. Reasons for the difference in norms
of society versus the norms of the organization include incentives and
constraints specific to the organization. There is also a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias">selection bias</a>
in the people who join a bureaucratic organization, and there is a
selection bias to who stays in a bureaucratic environment. The people in
a bureaucratic organization are unlikely to be perfectly representative
of the society that the organization serves. Tactics that work inside a
bureaucratic organization may not apply in society, and tactics that are
useful outside an organization may not work on bureaucrats.</p>
<p>There are specific attributes that make a candidate more likely to be
successful in a bureaucracy, regardless of the role they are being hired
into. In addition to role-specific skills, hire candidates with the
ability to reflect on thinking (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a>),
navigating complex social scenarios with competing interests, and
intrinsic motivation are useful. If you're a candidate bureaucrat you
can develop these traits.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="tips-for-getting-started"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Tips for Getting Started</h2>
<p>You may have graduated from school with a degree in a specific
subject. Then you go to work and expect the position you're in to apply
the domain-specific education you have in your new role. Your work
produces an outcome and gives meaning to the struggle of your prior
education process (an investment of time, money, and effort). In
practice, there can be a disconnect between your professional role and
your educational training. The disconnect may feel dissatisfying when
you are not practicing what you went to school for.</p>
<p>An alternative framing that is more helpful is that you went to
school to learn how to learn. A degree represents your ability to learn
and persist rather than a domain specialization. Then, when you get to
work, you are presented with new opportunities to learn other
domains.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="onboarding-into-a-bureaucratic-organization">Onboarding into a
Bureaucratic Organization</h3>
<p>The hiring process involves at least two people. Responsibility for
successful integration relies on both people actively working together.
This cooperative effort manifests in a few specific tactics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As the new hire, try to learn the names of those around you. As the
hirer, make introductions. Not just the first time, but for the first
week or two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As the new hire, learn the jargon of your new organization. As the
hirer, explicitly expand jargon when used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As the new hire, seek one-on-one meetings to get feedback. As the hirer,
offer one-on-one meetings to provide feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
As the new hire, write documentation on processes as you experience
them. You're in the best position to write down your observations
because you are seeing things for the first time. As the hirer, provide
documentation on processes. Your organization gets value from new hires
faster when they are efficiently trained.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-orient-yourself">How to Orient
Yourself</h3>
<p>Sometimes your role as a bureaucrat may be poorly defined. The lack
of direction or objectives may feel disappointing or frustrating. This
is especially the true for your first job having just left the
structured environment of school. The positive perspective is that you
can define your tasks and determine what would be helpful or
interesting.</p>
<p>Two mentalities that are useful throughout your career are enabling
other people through collaboration and working yourself out of the job.
Your goal is to facilitate success rather than being integral to the
process. Enabling other people to be successful can apply to subjects,
fellow bureaucrats, or management. Not everyone matters equally, so
figuring out the priority of helping specific people informs your
decision.</p>
<p>Another tactic is to look around, look backward, and look forward.
What are the challenges the team or organization faces? Then review
previous attempts to address the challenges. Why did previous efforts
fail to remedy the situation? Once you have a less na&#xEF;ve view and more
context, what is your vision of the desired scenario? Without this
vision for improvement, there is a danger of doing work that keeps you
busy but yields no progress.</p>
<p>The tactics of identifying challenges and learning the history of a
challenge often rely on social interactions. A bureaucratic organization
rarely maintains a searchable written record of decisions and failed
efforts. If that content is available, it may lack the specificity
available from a verbal narrative by people who were present. When
investigating issues in a bureaucracy, end discovery-oriented
conversations with the question, "Who else should I talk to about this
issue?" Independent of the prior content or the quality of the preceding
discussion, this question can be the entry point to an extensive
second-order social network of expertise that is often separate from the
hierarchical chain of command. If multiple discussions with different
people lead to the same person, then that person is key.</p>
<p>Documenting your process as you proceed can help with self-reflection
and your ability to measure progress. Written documentation of your
status can be used as proactive updates to your management and provides
a record when someone asks why you took certain actions (rather than
coming up with after-the-event rationalizations).</p>
<p>Bureaucratic challenges that do not violate the constraints of Nature
(such as conservation of momentum, conservation of mass, the speed of
light, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg's
Uncertainty principle</a>) are solvable. There are typically political,
social, personality, security, and technical aspects that need to be
accounted for. Laws can be changed, regulations altered, people
replaced, and norms updated. Constraints that appear to be logically
inconsistent may be reframed to be resolved. Narrowing or broadening the
scope may reset the context for a challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The tactics provided above can help you be an effective bureaucrat.
Because there is variability to effectiveness there can be emotional
highs and lows. The next section discusses the emotional aspect of
bureaucracy.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="setting-your-emotional-state"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Setting Your Emotional
State</h2>
<p>As a member of a bureaucratic organization, you may feel the
frustration of bureaucracy, the happiness of success, the excitement of
possibilities, or the fear of uncertainty of operating in a complicated
environment. Your emotional state alters your productivity and the
well-being of your coworkers, regardless of whether that emotion was set
by your work or set by events outside the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>You may see emotions as getting in the way of productivity and
creating problems, or perhaps you see emotions as unprofessional. This
view is not shared by everyone, and there are real benefits to feelings
like passion, enthusiasm, excitement, and joy. Yes, joy can be felt by
bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Expecting bureaucrats to apply cold, rational logic to decisions and
interactions is unrealistic. Openness to engaging emotionally is more
constructive than avoiding or suppressing emotional aspects of the
job.</p>
<p>One source of emotions inspired by bureaucracy is when your roles,
responsibilities, and resources do not align with those of other people
you engage with. You want to be effective and feel frustrated. This
frustration can infect your interactions with coworkers.</p>
<p>Another source of emotions in a bureaucratic organization is when you
see someone else making what appears to be a poor decision or policy. If
you cannot alter the decision or influence the policy, this can feel
disheartening or demoralizing. Worse, these policies outside your
control may be of consequence to you.</p>
<p>A third set of emotions in bureaucratic interactions occurs when a
group of bureaucrats with distinct perspectives, strong opinions, and
diverse experiences faced with complex challenges have insufficient time
to create consensus and select the optimal choice. Stress felt by each
participant informs the interaction.</p>
<p>These emotional states are relevant because frustration and stress
can decrease your capacity for effective communication. Happier
bureaucrats can be more productive and collaborative.</p>
<p>By identifying these emotional patterns, the situation can seem less
personal. Your feelings are legitimate, but they are not unique to you.
Anyone in that situation is likely to feel similarly. Realizing this
helps build empathy instead of ignoring the feeling. You can ask other
people how a situation makes them feel. There's value in both shared
experience and identifying different responses.</p>
<p>The next section on a specific artifact of bureaucracy may seem
separate from your emotions, but how information is framed can inform
your expectations. These subtle expectations about your environment
inform your feelings of what is acceptable or not.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="organization-chart-orientation">Organization
chart orientation <span id="sec:org-chart-orientation"
label="sec:org-chart-orientation"></span></h4>
<p>A common method of describing relations within the bureaucracy is the
organization chart (commonly the "<span data-acronym-label="org chart"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">org chart</span>"). Normally the
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is at the top of the chart, middle
management is in the middle, and managed employees are at the bottom.
See Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top">4.1</a>.</p>
<p>Artifacts like org charts subtly convey an organization's culture.
There are emotional connotations to alternative layouts. You can alter
expected relations (culture and norms) by playing with the orientation
of the org chart. There is a risk of overanalyzing org chart
orientation, so the exploration in this section is limited.</p>
<p>The point of thinking about org chart orientation is to frame how you
perceive your chain of command, peers, and (if applicable) the
bureaucrats you manage. Notice that the framing is embedded in the words
-- prefixes super (over) and sub (under). These concepts inform what you
expect from relations with supervisors and subordinates. Do I seek
support or direction and guidance from my supervisor? What do I expect
from my supervisor? My peers? The people I oversee? What do I expect to
provide them?</p>
<p>The relative orientation of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">CEO</a> to
the workers sets expectations for relations. Options for orientation are
the conventional CEO at the top (Figure&nbsp;<a

class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Learning from Failure<span
id="sec:learn-from-failure" label="sec:learn-from-failure"></span></h2>
<p>Framing of emotions is crucial for learning. Wisdom comes from
experience comes from failure, but if you are afraid to fail you'll have
fewer opportunities to learn. While you should learn from the experience
of other people, you will also need to cope with the anxiety that can
come with decision-making. This section on individual failure is
separate from <a href="#sec:org-failure-and-success">how an organization
characterizes failure</a>.</p>
<p>Making progress in a bureaucracy is not a linear sequence of steps.
Ideally there is an ongoing cycle of trying something, not succeeding,
and then applying what you learn towards the next try. This idealized
"<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast%23Business">fail-fast</a>"
cycle does not occur naturally -- participants need either intrinsic
motivation or external incentives to make progress. Failing as a path
for learning is justified after having exhausted less expensive
alternative education opportunities like reading books, going to school,
and talking with experts.</p>
<p>The recognition of failure depends on a clear measurement. Do the
participants know the relevant measure? Can they make the measurement?
Having a defined measure of failure and regularly making the measurement
relies on having an understanding of the expectations for the
situation.</p>
<p>Assumptions can be categorized as opinions, guesses, or based on
experience. For example, opinions on the interpretation of policy. In
that context policy interpretation can be bent or exceptions can be
made. Guesses can be stated as, "Given multiple options, X seems most
likely." If someone else is making a guess, you can express curiosity
about the basis for their reasoning. Lastly, experience can be
extrapolated: "Last time X happened, so next time..." In this situation
it can be worth asking others if they have similar or different
experiences.</p>
<p>Failure with respect to expectations implies thinking about the
future so that you can measure your progress (or failure). That is a
subset of planning. You can fail if you don't plan, and you can fail if
you do plan. This does not indicate that planning is irrelevant. Plans
can be overly detailed and prescriptive, or plans can be inadequately
specified; both are unhelpful.</p>
<p>If your measurements indicate failure, this could be due to an
invalid assumption (with a valid objective) or you may have selected a
bad objective. Declaring failure means re-evaluating assumptions,
resetting objectives, or giving up on the concept and doing something
else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
There are ways to avoid failing: by not setting an objective, or setting
an objective that isn't measurable. You can avoid the appearance of
failure by not telling anyone the objective. Extrinsic accountability
for failure requires other people to have awareness. If the criteria for
failure are not known to other people, it may be because the person (or,
<a href="#sec:org-failure-and-success">in the next section</a>, the
organization) doesn't want to share how they've failed until they have a
success.</p>
<p>Understanding rationales like the failure avoidance mentality is
critical if you want to avoid feeling baffled the first time you
encounter it. By learning these bureaucratic anti-patterns, you can
inoculate yourself emotionally and cognitively -- there will be less
surprise when you encounter it. You now have a chance to think ahead
before encountering the situation.</p>
<p>A counterargument when you hear that someone is avoiding failure is
to explain that noticing failure is essential to improving. Detecting
indicators of failure, addressing the cause, and then changing is the
process of improvement. Being more efficient involves decreasing
incidents of failure, but that can also become brittle (not robust).
When someone wants to avoid failure, how do they expect to find novel
effective ways to do things?</p>
<h2 data-number="4.5"
id="success-and-failure-in-your-organization"><span
class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Success (and Failure) in Your
Organization<span id="sec:org-failure-and-success"
label="sec:org-failure-and-success"></span></h2>
<p>This section on how a team or organization conceptualizes failure is
separate from <a href="#sec:learn-from-failure">learning from
failure</a> as an individual bureaucrat because the two concepts are
distinct. Pondering team and organization success is relevant to you
because your individual success needs to align with how your team
defines success.</p>
<p>Understanding the ways your organization (or team) succeeds or fails
matters to you because it affects how you are evaluated and how you feel
about your work. Success and failure should ideally be measured against
a quantitative objective that was agreed upon in advance by all
stakeholders. While theoretically feasible, in practice most
organizations do not enact these discussions.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations have varying definitions of success and
failure because organizations are made up of individual bureaucrats with
a multitude of motives and weak feedback mechanisms. There are a few
macro-level patterns for organizations. Each pattern has a consequence
on the individual bureaucrats operating within the organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A bureaucratic organization that provides infrastructure service (such
as a public water utility, an electrical power company, or an
organization's internal computer support team) has a specific failure
mode. When infrastructure is unavailable or degraded, that's a failure.
Success means satisfactory operation at a minimal cost. An organization
operating in this context is motivated to avoid failure. Success is a
lack of failure or improved efficiency. An effort to improve processes
or otherwise innovate will face the inertia of a culture organized
around avoiding failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A bureaucratic organization that claims "wins" but no failures (because
either more or different work is needed) is difficult to be productive
in when the successful outcome has ill-defined value. The success can be
counted (number of wins), but the relative importance of the success is
unclear.</p>
<p>Examples of win-focused organizations include law enforcement,
research teams, and teams with a responsibility for innovation.</p>
<p>For an organization focused on "wins," funding depends on how
convincing these success narratives are. This biases the organization to
focus on investments most likely to get more funding. When the funding
for an organization does not come from consumers of products or policies
created by the organization, there is a disconnect. The "wins" may not
be helpful to the consumer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
An organization that works to improve the productivity of other
organizations may have neither successes nor failures. Money and time
are invested with the hope that results will be useful to someone else
at some future time. If the organization didn't exist no outcome would
be significantly affected. Any win might be attributable to either
organization, and any failure can be attributed to either organization.
As with no-failure organizations, success is focused on anecdotes and
narratives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Your ability to be effective requires identifying which of the above
models describes the organization you are a member of. The foundation of
your Process Empathy relies on recognizing the incentives of the
organization you are in. Understanding how your organization defines
success and failure is vital to your emotional well-being as well as
your ability to get promoted.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.6" id="promotion"><span
class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Promotion<span
id="sec:promotion" label="sec:promotion"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucrats get promoted for a variety of reasons: due to their
technical competence, a role needs to be filled, to motivate retention,
or for their managerial ability. Not being promoted can feel like a
slight against you for any of those reasons.</p>
<p>In this section, folk wisdom illustrates the frustration bureaucrats
have with promotion. The purpose of familiarizing yourself with these
common sentiments is to understand that the failures of promotion are
not specific to the team you are on or the organization you are a member
of. The deficiencies are generic to hierarchy. With this insight, you
can choose a more emotionally healthy response to the situation. Process
Empathy is intended to produce emotional resilience based on an improved
understanding of the situation you are in.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="folk-wisdom-about-promotion">Folk Wisdom
about Promotion</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_principle">Dilbert
principle</a> says organizations "Systematically promote incompetent
employees to management to get them out of the workflow." A
similar-in-spirit observation is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putt%27s_Law_and_the_Successful_Technocrat">Putt's
Law</a> which says, "<del>Technology</del>[Bureaucracy] is dominated by
two types of people, those who understand what they do not manage and
those who manage what they do not understand." Those two observations
are post-hoc rationalizations for managers lacking managerial skills and
technical skills.</p>
<p>For bureaucrats who don't seem effective in their role, try to
determine whether there is a lack of training, lack of awareness, or
lack of interest. Training can take the form of reading books or
attending classes. Lack of awareness can be addressed with measurements
of turnover rate and surveying team members.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle">Peter
principle</a>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="1970_Peter">(Peter
1970)</span> says, "People in a hierarchy tend to rise to 'a level of
respective incompetence': employees are promoted based on their success
in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer
competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to
another." This incompetence might manifest as recurring failure for a
person in a role they are inadequate for. More likely, your incompetence
will blind you to your failures.</p>
<p>To avoid falling victim to the Peter Principle, do not seek promotion
until you have a track record of performing at the next level. The
downside is that you are working at a discounted rate since you are
providing value beyond what is expected of your rank. (That's Dilemma&nbsp;<a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-work-extra-or-work-as-expected"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:dilemma-personal-work-extra-or-work-as-expected">3.9</a>.)</p>
<p>The Peter principle has an element of truth, especially when a person
starts a new role. It takes time to find your footing in a new job.
However, you can learn the role and become competent.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="designing-incentives-to-align-with-values">Designing Incentives to
Align with Values</h3>
<p>Promotion is critical when designing incentives for behavior.
Promotion is challenging to engineer because people are driven by
various motives like money, status, and authority.</p>
<p>Promotion typically focuses on the past success of a person. This
de-emphasizes teamwork and lessons learned from failures. Promotion of a
person (rather than the team) results in hero culture.</p>
<p>The risk tolerance of a bureaucratic organization is driven in part
by conflicts of interest in the promotion processes: an interest in
success (more success is better) and avoidance of failure (organizations
typically don't promote members for failing). This imbalance can lead
participants to seek ownership of efforts that are likely to succeed, to
seek easier successes, and to steal credit for outcomes created by other
people.</p>
<p>The promotion process within an organization is often coupled to the
concept of innovation, even if your promotion is at odds with taking
risks. The next section describes why innovating within a bureaucratic
organization is challenging and how to be effective.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.7"
id="ideas-for-innovation-within-a-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Ideas for Innovation within a
Bureaucracy<span id="sec:innovation" label="sec:innovation"></span></h2>
<p>As a bureaucrat in an organization, you will see deficiencies and
challenges. You could ignore the issues, complain but not take action,
work around (avoid) the issues, or try to improve your organization.
This section focuses on the last option.</p>
<p>Sometimes the issue and the fix seem straightforward. If the
situation has persisted for a long time, consider why the conditions
have remained as-is. Instead of framing your idea with, "Isn't it
obvious that things would be better if...", learn why what seems obvious
doesn't happen. Learn the history. Talk to participants. If there is
agreement that the situation is harmful, why has no one else tackled it?
If previous attempts to innovate were tried and failed, why did they
fail? What is novel about your innovation compared to those?<a
href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>If you understand the conditions creating a challenge, the history of
why other approaches failed, and you have an innovative response,
consider the stakeholders. Innovation is necessarily disruptive to
incumbent processes, teams, and social power. Do the incumbents benefit
from the proposed innovation? Have they said they will benefit or are
you projecting their response? Innovation that helps the organization
but harms incumbents is less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>In addition to the social hurdles, innovation requires taking risks
(otherwise the effort is merely incremental improvement). Risk in an
organization means the potential for losing time and resources (waste),
potential harm to reputation, or legal consequences.</p>
<p>Avoiding waste and harm are rational reactions when you are managing
shared resources on behalf of a community. The incentive against
innovation is the minimization of failure.</p>
<p>Anyone who fails can argue they were trying to innovate. The
distinction of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast%23Business">fail-fast</a>
from failure-as-wasteful requires that you learn from failure and you
share insight gained so other people don't need to repeat your
experience. You can also learn from the failures of others, though these
conversations can be painful for the person who failed to revisit.</p>
<p>Once you decide to innovate, and after you've learned the history and
talked to participants, you have choices about how to innovate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Innovate while ignoring the bureaucracy. Your scope is limited to
what you can accomplish alone. Integration is tough and causes
frustration for stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>Fight to create a space free from bureaucracy to enable
innovation. You've intentionally isolated innovators from resources
present in the organization, and integration back into the org is now
more challenging.</p></li>
<li><p>Leverage existing hierarchy and processes. Working with
bureaucrats who are not as focused as you are can be
frustrating.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no obvious best solution -- just a Pareto frontier of
suboptimal trade-offs.</p>
<p>The innovation lifecycle is a sequence of decisions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You see problems and challenges in your environment. This
manifests as complaints from both the people directly harmed and
observers who see inefficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>You share ideas for innovation and get feedback. Build a
coalition of people willing to fight for the idea on your behalf so that
when you're not present, the idea is still proceeding toward
implementation. That puts the threshold at "so important other people
are willing to pause whatever they were working on and take up your
cause."</p></li>
<li><p>Enacting these suggestions requires either a change to existing
processes or new processes or an investment of work. These changes may
not succeed -- there's risk. Your idea could fail because it's not a good
idea. It could also fail because someone doesn't like you, or the idea
doesn't account for some dependency you weren't aware of, or it might
conflict with other changes in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do decide to invest effort, the activity takes you away
from your current work. Enacting the change might involve skills you
don't have; learning those skills takes time. Carrying out the activity
with new skills increases the likelihood of novice mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>If someone else enacts the idea they get the credit for having
done the work.</p></li>
<li><p>If the idea saves money or time, there is not reliably a monetary
reward. Recognition and improved reputation are not required as part of
the change process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are many barriers in that sequence. If the person you need to
engage with isn't harmed by what you see as a problem, that person may
not see benefit from resolving inefficiency. You have to build a
coalition of stakeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In addition to the work of enacting the change, there is an
administrative overhead of documenting the reason for the change.
Decisions are subjective so choices have to be defensible. The need for
defensible justifications results in conservative decisions, risk
aversion, and decreased motive for innovation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A common example is that organizations don't buy new technology because
there are lots of risks, and members already know how to use the
existing technology. (The same reasoning applies to innovation with
policies.)</p>
<p>The people in decision-making positions in the hierarchy have more
experience with existing technology and are therefore biased against
novel technology. Also, getting burned a few times on innovation makes
people more conservative.</p>
<p>With limited time and staff available within the organization,
experienced decision-makers are typically not on the bleeding edge of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">hype
cycle</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Bureaucrats, recognizing that bureaucracy stifles innovation, will
occasionally invest in internal innovation efforts. Because innovation
can come from unexpected sources, the process of innovation is open to
everyone.</p>
<p>Incompetent people can innovate just as much as well-informed
experts, but the output of inexperienced people is more likely to be
disappointing, wasteful, or even harmful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p>These barriers lead external observers to the following
simplification&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="1987_Herbert">(Herbert
1987)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats
hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better
results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top
of the heap look inept. Who enjoys appearing inept?"</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The motive for providing the explanations above is the observation
that bureaucrats who are persistently innovative in complicated
organizations have a strong grasp of the above pitfalls and build
relationships with stakeholders to compensate. Effective bureaucrats
still fail because not all the aspects are controllable or
predictable.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="changing-your-environment">Changing your
Environment</h3>
<p>Changing the bureaucratic organization you are a member of is
difficult. That applies regardless of your motive for change and the
thing to be changed. Regardless of motive, there are tactics applicable
to any change. The two major categories of change are <a
href="#sec:change-a-process">processes</a> (e.g., technical solutions,
changing policy) and changing the <span data-acronym-label="culture"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">culture</span> of the members of an
organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Culture is the set of norms that determine acceptable behavior for
members of the organization. Norms are the expectations of your fellow
bureaucrats. Each member of the organization can model desired behavior
and inflict punishment for deviation from norms. The culture of the
organization is practiced by members.</p>
<p>The expectations of an organization should be stated explicitly so
that members cannot use the defense that they were not aware. If the
stated norms conflict with what is experienced by the organization's
members and left unaddressed, the hypocrisy decimates trust.</p>
<p>Besides modeling desired norms in the organization, there are a few
more tactics you can take. You can reinforce examples of desired
behavior with public praise and meaningful rewards. You can counsel
people who go against the culture and punish instances of undesirable
norms.</p>
<p>Altering the culture of an organization means altering member
behavior and expectation. This is accomplished by adjusting incentives
to reinforce the desired behavior, punishing undesirable behavior, and
providing resources to make the intended outcomes easier.</p>
<p>Although aspects of culture may be problematic, thinking of cultural
change as problem-solving can be a misleading framing. Rather than solve
problems think of change as addressing challenges. Altering the culture
often introduces novel challenges. Even though you don't solve a
challenge, you can still get a sense of emotional reward from having
improved the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Before investing effort in change, reflect on the emotional and career
impact of your effort. Will the work bring you joy, or is your emotional
reward tied to the outcome? If the outcome is the only source of reward,
you'll either be disappointed in failure or you will be more
conservative (intending to increase the likelihood of success). The work
of creating positive change can be joyful: you can form relationships
and focus on learning.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of change in a bureaucratic organization is
figuring out what is worth changing. There are many opportunities for
improvement. Talk to stakeholders and enumerate their challenges. From
the myriad stories, identify recurring themes and root causes. Typically
bureaucratic challenges intertwine technical, budget, staffing,
historical context, personalities of participants, and organizational
politics.</p>
<p>Select an aspect that you have some competence in and would
facilitate personal growth. If the challenge is big (many people
involved, takes a long time, costs a lot), can it be broken down into
incremental challenges? Distinguish wide-scale changes you envision from
local changes over which you have more influence.</p>
<p>Having surveyed challenges worth addressing and having picked an
issue with a high return on investment, the guidance of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton%23Chesterton%27s_fence">Chesterton's
fence</a> section&nbsp;<a href="#concept:chestertons_fence"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="concept:chestertons_fence">[concept:chestertons_fence]</a>
is that you shouldn't change something until you understand why things
are the way they are. Figuring out the history of an issue requires work
when there is a lack of historical records.</p>
<p>Talking to stakeholders in the survey phase may yield tidbits of
history. Why have previous efforts been rejected or not taken effect?
Your review of written documentation of the history should be augmented
by seeking out oral folklore.</p>
<p>If your idea has a novel justification for success, identify all
possible methods of progress and then rank the tasks. If you can't do
all the work, who can you collaborate with? Can you delegate to people
with skills you lack, or will you have to gain new skills? If no one has
the relevant skills, becoming the widely-acknowledged expert improves
your influence.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="creating-change-in-the-organization">Creating
Change in the Organization<span id="sec:creating-change"
label="sec:creating-change"></span></h3>
<p>If the organization you are in has no problems or challenges, this
section can be skipped. For bureaucrats in organizations that do have
issues, this part of the book provides points to ponder independent of
the specific problem.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you have unique insight into the challenges the
organization faces, and you have unique leverage to alter the situation.
While you could proceed haphazardly, an effective bureaucrat has vision
-- a story of what could be. This vision can be broken into goals --
specific, measurable outcomes. Each goal requires contingency plans for
achieving the goal. Plans are marked by milestones that indicate whether
the plan is proceeding successfully.</p>
<p>Perspectives to consider when assessing change include what the
situation is, what the situation could be, and what the situation looks
like for different stakeholders. Each person has different information,
a different way of responding to issues, and shifting intents.</p>
<p>People you depend on who have conflicting visions or no vision
confound your ability to improve the organization. There are different
views on whether something is a problem, distinct characterizations of
an issue, and competing priorities.</p>
<p>A trade-off to consider is that having a n&#xEF;che impact is easier than
broad change (the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-scope-broad-vs-narrow">Dilemma of Scope of
Effect</a>). There's also a trade-off of the quick fix versus more
robust solutions (the <a
href="#table:dilemma-personal-quick-methodical">Dilemma of Speed and
Accuracy</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Understand and empathize with people who fear
change.<br />
When faced with a challenge, the options are to take action or not take
action. If you take action, the options are failure, success, or
iteration. Action incurs risk due to uncertainty and costs work to
create change. The choice of not taking action is attractive if you are
not suffering. Even if change would decrease suffering, delay minimizes
work and there are other things to focus on.</p>
<p>Fear of failure is justified if the cost of the failure is greater
than the value of lessons learned.</p>
<p>Fear of iteration is a fear that the process might be stopped
prematurely -- before perfection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Before starting a new effort, check to see whether
this has been tackled before. Learn the history of the problem. Why
hasn't this been solved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Learn the folklore. Talk with your first- and
second-order social network. Ask your coworkers, and ask them who else
you should talk with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Use social recommendations by naming relevant
individuals.<br />
Leverage the trust already in an existing social network by starting
with "Person A recommended I talk to you about X."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Sit in on meetings, listen to topics, see who is
talking, and see who is attending. After the meeting, talk to
individuals about the meeting. Set up one-on-one informal discussions.
Keep the first conversation brief - 10 or 15 minutes. Your body language
should indicate engagement and interest. "Who else would you recommend
talking to?" is the last question in the first conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Get feedback early before polishing. This iterative
approach enables you to account for the concerns of stakeholders and
decreases their surprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Advertise the result. Don't rely on the change
being sufficient for people to be aware the change happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Hear criticism and respond. Ignoring feedback harms
relationships. People who complain want to at least be heard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Leverage both social networks and bureaucratic
processes. This requires building and maintaining relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Identify sources of power (hierarchical positions
and titles, social influence, reputation and credibility, buzzphrases or
popular paradigms) and leverage them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Suggestion</em>: Conduct your interactions with professional respect
(for what the other person knows) and professional curiosity (for what
you don't know).<br />
Example: Getting approval from multiple overseers in different
hierarchies is hard. Often different stakeholders have different
objectives and incentives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Consensus doesn't mean everyone agrees on the problem, the remedy, the
approach, or who's taking action. Consensus in a bureaucracy means
people aren't going to resist the change.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="social-and-bureaucratic-interactions">Social
and Bureaucratic interactions<span id="sec:socializing"
label="sec:socializing"></span></h3>
<p>Change in a bureaucracy can apply to processes and people, but a more
amorphous concept is changing the culture of a team or organization.
What is meant by "culture" usually refers to norms -- the expectations of
behavior that individuals hold to in the absence of policies or rules.
That definition of culture is generic; what is meant within a
bureaucratic context requires new labels for specific expectations.</p>
<p>To evaluate expectations, we start by introducing categories of
interactions. Interactions among members of an organization are either a
social interaction or a bureaucratic interaction.</p>
<p>As examples of each of these,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Social interaction example</em>: "Did you see the game on TV
last night? Our team did fantastic, right? I wanted to get tickets for
the game, but they were sold out."</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bureaucratic interaction example</em>: "You'll need to get
approval from Sue before presenting your idea to the board for their
review. Then talk with Russ and get his thoughts about how to
proceed."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both social and bureaucratic interactions are vital to cohesion in an
organization. Engaging exclusively in either will decrease cohesion.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic interaction can be broken into two subcategories: <span
data-acronym-label="visible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">visible bureaucracy</span> (processes
are written down and can be discovered by stakeholders) and <span
data-acronym-label="invisible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">invisible bureaucracy</span>
(processes are known to some stakeholders and are conveyed verbally to
some of the other stakeholders).</p>
<p>Invisible bureaucracy is akin to related topics outside the
professional environment: invisible domestic work<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
and invisible relationship work.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> The work associated
with emotional cohesion, logistics, planning, scheduling, and
communicating is hard to quantify so it does not get counted.</p>
<p>The relevance of this jargon is to break down the components of an
organization's "culture" experienced by participants. When someone in
the organization advocates for changing the culture, which expectations
are they specifically referring to? Invisible bureaucracy is the hardest
to alter because it is undocumented and not counted.</p>
<p>Processes default to invisible bureaucracy because creating and
maintaining documentation requires work. Making the documentation
discoverable requires work. To make invisible bureaucracy visible,
document the work and enable other people to find the documentation.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.8" id="measuring-bureaucratic-maturity"><span
class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Measuring Bureaucratic
Maturity</h2>
<p>Bureaucratic maturity of bureaucrats in an organization can be broken
into three stages of behavior: complaining (acknowledges an issue but
doesn't seek to resolve), seeing opportunity ("what if we..."), and
finally enacting <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudges</a> (ways to
alter behaviors) or altering incentives.</p>
<p>The first and most widespread behavior is to see a problem and then
complain about the situation. This indicates an awareness of the
environment but no creativity regarding what to do about the
problems.</p>
<p>The second, less common behavior, is to see a problem and recognize
the situation as an opportunity. This requires creativity and
reframing.</p>
<p>The third behavior is to see a problem and then alter the situation
toward a vision. The vision could be in the form of a long-term
(temporally distant) outcome, or the vision could be of immediate
multi-party cooperation. Changes could be through either direct action
or by influencing others.</p>
<p>An individual bureaucrat can show one or more of these behaviors.
That is, being capable of the third behavior still allows the person to
complain about other topics.</p>
<p>There is not a specific amount of experience within the organization
needed to arrive at any of these three paradigms. A holistic
understanding of the system helps.</p>

</p>
<p><em>The previous chapter focused on you. When working with a team in
an organization you are not the main character. This chapter provides
advice for navigating an organization comprised of bureaucrats who are
not like you.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
You were hired to do a job. Your job relies on skills you've accumulated
through education and experience. Now you're a member of the team.
You'll need to interact with other bureaucrats for various reasons:
delegating tasks, asking for help, offering help, seeking input, and
offering input. While that generic observation sounds reasonable, in
practice you encounter significant friction in getting things done. If
everyone participating in a process thinks they are doing the right
thing, then why are there suboptimal outcomes? Potential reasons
include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each participant in the process may have a limited view of other
parts of the process. Each person talks only to adjacent
participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Each participant typically has a limited scope of responsibility.
They don't need to know everything, which can lead to incorrect
decision-making. Specialization can simultaneously improve efficiency
and cause harm by narrowing scope.</p></li>
<li><p>Each participant typically has a limited scope of authority. Even
if the person knows more than their role, they lack control over other
aspects of the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants typically have insufficient time, resources, and
expertise to enact improvements. There may be a theoretical "best
outcome" but practical resource constraints result in suboptimal
outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants in the process may have a common goal but use
different methods for addressing the challenges. This results in
friction even though the destination is agreed upon.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all potential constraints; they don't exclude being
effective or improving the process. For example, you can learn what
someone else's priorities are and why those are priorities. Then you can
take action that accounts for other perspectives.</p>
<p>Solo work may be more emotionally rewarding due to fewer external
constraints, but the cost is that task complexity and scope are limited
to the skills of the individual.</p>
<p>When you can't do everything yourself, you rely on your team and
members of the broader organization. You can choose to treat this loss
of independence within the organization (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindividuation">deindividuation</a>)
as either sublimation (and feel suffocated) or an extension of your
capacity and abilities (and feel empowered).</p>
<p>Working with others allows you to occasionally achieve complex
results beyond your skills or your bandwidth despite collaborators not
being under your control. How? Through persuasion. The challenge of
collaboration is to multiply productivity rather than merely sum the
output of a set of individuals.</p>
<p>Inside an organization, cooperation and coordination are not held
together by internal contracts or even <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">service-level
agreements</a>.</p>
<p>What keeps the organization together is the force of will of
participants. You engage other bureaucrats because you see merit in
doing so, and the same perspective applies to every other person in the
organization.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="time-attention-and-alertness">Time,
Attention, and Alertness</h3>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations are comprised of humans. Your intent to be
an effective bureaucrat must account for this aspect. When you engage
fellow bureaucrats as part of a process, you are investing your <span
data-acronym-label="attention-time"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">attention-time</span> in the
relationship. Relationships take time, which is time not spent on other
opportunities. In addition to your time (and theirs), the other two
factors are your attention and alertness. To illustrate the relevance of
those aspects, consider the following. I can talk to you for 15 minutes,
but if your attention is directed toward your phone or computer then
you're not fully engaged with me. If you are paying attention during the
time we have together but haven't slept for 36 hours, your alertness may
not be 100%.</p>
<p>When interacting with fellow bureaucrats, are you giving them your
attention? Are you alert to their input? While engaging, determine if
they are not attentive or alert. You can be curious and ask if deferring
the interaction would allow them to give more of their attention. If
you're not feeling alert, let the people you're interacting with know.
Being tired, hungry, or distracted is part of being human. Accounting
for imperfect attention and alertness improves your process empathy.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.1" id="motives-of-bureaucrats"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Motives of Bureaucrats<span
id="sec:motivations" label="sec:motivations"></span></h2>
<p>Learning the diverse motives of bureaucrats you depend upon is
instructive for finding causes of delay or opposition. If you expect
everyone to have the same motives as you, then you will be surprised by
the friction created by diverse motives.</p>
<p>Motivations of participants are rarely, "How can I make the
organization more successful?" or even, "How can I sell or produce more
product?" Usually, motivation is based on personal fulfillment in
various manifestations. Learning the motives of each bureaucrat - what
they value in terms of a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">utility function</a> and
how they perceive risk - enables you to gather data that is personally
relevant to the argument you're making and frame your narrative more
effectively.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats on the same team with similar skill sets have similar
external incentives. However, their intrinsic motives may be different
and result in distinct behaviors. Within an organization, bureaucrats
differ due to their intrinsic motivations, extrinsic incentives, and
each person's risk tolerance. These three factors combine into emergent
phenomena, leading teams and organizations to act in ways no individual
member would. The dissonance of how (personified) organizations behave
confounds observers outside the bureaucracy. If you were to talk to each
member, you could find a reason for that person's behavior. Bureaucrats
do not act randomly.</p>
<p>Each bureaucrat has a motive, even the bureaucrats who do nothing.
Bureaucratic nihilism (showing up for your job but choosing to not
provide value) is an option, but it is not without cost. In an
organization where you are a paid bureaucrat, you are either actively
working to improve the organization or your existence is parasitic to
the organization. There is no "idle" status for paid employees in an
organization with limited resources.</p>
<p>Employees may choose to stop contributing value if they perceive that
a lack of action will not harm their options. There is a perceived
disconnect between their actions and the consequences for the
organization. This is not pure <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism">nihilism</a>, as the
person still benefits from showing up (usually a paycheck).</p>
<p>Rationalizing money as the cause for action is just one of many
potential sources. There are a variety of motivations and incentives for
bureaucrats: stability (aka job security, the comfort of a routine),
money (current pay or future earnings), travel, problem-solving, social
status, exerting power or control, the credibility of being associated
with the organization (if the organization has a positive reputation),
logistical convenience ("the office is near where I live"), and service
to people the organization serves.</p>
<p>As an example incentive for a bureaucrat, I want to avoid being too
efficient such that I eliminate the need for my job, while not so
inefficient that the organization fails and I lose my job. Increasing
the efficiency of bureaucracy is desirable for the organization and the
outcomes, but can be harmful to the bureaucrat's career.</p>
<p>The consequence of diverse motives is that expecting bureaucratic
organizations to be logical, fair, consistent, and efficient is
unreasonable even when every participant wants those features. Each
bureaucrat thinks, "I am logical, fair, consistent, and efficient."
Therefore each bureaucrat expects other bureaucrats to meet those same
(unrealistic) standards. The next step in thinking is to personify the
team or organization and expect the group to meet those standards.</p>
<p>Even if each bureaucrat were logical, fair, consistent, and efficient
(they are not, and neither are you), each person has a different
motivation. At the same time, each person wants to accomplish something
using their skills. Compounding the confusion, each bureaucrat has to
coordinate using communication that has latency, limited bandwidth, and
isn't precise.</p>
<p>When viewed from the outside, bureaucracy can appear illogical,
unfair, inconsistent, and inefficient. From inside the bureaucracy, each
bureaucrat is driven by different motives and uses distinct ways to
tackle challenges. Working against bureaucratic entropy (an ongoing
investment) yields improvements even though perfection may be
inaccessible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The above discussion might leave you with the impression that individual
bureaucrats are distinct. While that's true, with a sufficient number of
different people there are recurring themes that are detectable. The
next section identifies common tropes you might encounter.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.2" id="bureaucratic-tropes"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Bureaucratic Tropes<span
id="sec:tropes" label="sec:tropes"></span></h2>
<p>Any sufficiently large organization will have a diverse group of
bureaucrats. From that diversity certain tropes emerge&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="2017_Duffy">(Duffy 2017)</span>. The value
of recognizing these recurring patterns is to leverage their strengths
so that you and that person can be more effective.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Excited intern or new
employee</strong>.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Their enthusiasm can be channeled to take on
challenges other bureaucrats are scared of taking on for political
reasons. Their na&#xEF;vet&#xE9; should be remedied by pairing them with a mentor
who can explain the organization's history and specific
challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Retired in place</strong>.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Recognizing this attitude allows you to temper
your expectations about their productivity.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Font of institutional memory</strong>.
Likes to explain how the current situation relates to his experience ten
years ago.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can benefit from talking to this person
about historical processes and what has been tried before.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>"Let them eat cake" managers</strong> who
are removed from challenges and deny the problem is a problem.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: It is worth figuring out whether these
managers don't care, or if they are busy fighting battles you are not
exposed to.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>"Don't rock the boat"</strong> people who
tried changing the system, didn't succeed, and are emotionally beaten
down such that they no longer try.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: These people are often creative and can be
consulted before you tackle a challenge they have experience
with.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>The Patriot</strong> is willing to
sacrifice for the organization.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Educate them that there are alternative ways
to be effective in a bureaucracy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Mismatched</strong> -- this person's
skills and interests don't match their role, so they are despondent and
frustrated.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can provide value to this person by
networking with them and finding better opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Friendly grouch</strong> is friendly and
helpful but unhappy in their job due to bureaucracy and other
hurdles.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Provide a copy of this book to increase their
effectiveness and improve their spirits. They will be grateful to you,
and the organization will benefit.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Detail-oriented</strong> -- you ask them
what time it is and they'll tell you how to build a clock.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can serve as their ambassador to other
members of the team or organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above personality tropes apply to individuals. If your team works
on multiple projects, you may identify project tropes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>We've always done it this
way</strong>.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: The team is scared of change. The change may be
known (and undesirable) or unknown. Change disrupts incumbent
power.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: You can brainstorm with the team ways to
improve incrementally.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trope</em>: <strong>Individual solutions to systemic
challenges</strong>.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Demonstrating small wins helps build
credibility.<br />
<em>What you can do</em>: Plan to ramp up complexity (towards the
systemic challenges) and <a href="#sec:reputation">spend the earned
reputation</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Team tropes can emerge from either the top-down directives made by
supervisors or by the collective (in)actions of team members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Tropes as labeled patterns of behavior can decrease surprise when you
first encounter them and can help you develop constructive
responses.</p>
<p>The last set of tropes is on the topic of bureaucratic problems.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-solve-problems">How to Solve
Problems</h3>
<p>Not every bureaucrat responds to challenges the same way.
Understanding the diversity of potential reactions (or inaction) before
you encounter them decreases the surprise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Solve the problem. This is the engineering approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a simpler problem. This is the Physics approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a more abstract problem. This is the Mathematical
approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a different problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize and ignore the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>What problem?</p></li>
<li><p>Assign someone else the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Redefine the problem so that it is already solved. "That's not a
problem; that's how it's supposed to work."</p></li>
<li><p>Point to the problem as a justification for more
resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply for resources (staff, training, money) to solve the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Give a talk about the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a paper about the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach a course on the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk to your therapist about the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Your manager declares the problem solved and gets a
bonus.</p></li>
<li><p>Reframe the problem as an opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p>Study the problem in the context of the broader system.</p></li>
<li><p>Study the problem from other people's perspectives.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the impact of the problem on the broader system.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a set of activities for role-playing parts of the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve part of the problem. Then another part.</p></li>
<li><p>Research whether anyone else worked on the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Find other instances of the problem that were already
solved.</p></li>
<li><p>Find similar problems and identify the differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Contract out the solution and select a bid.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why the problem does not need to be solved.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why the problem is beneficial.</p></li>
<li><p>Form a team and set a mission statement addressing the
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Slow-roll the problem until you don't need to worry about the
problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Did you recognize any of those responses from your past experiences?
Were any unexpected? Process Empathy expands beyond what you think
should happen to the realm of possible responses by your fellow
bureaucrats.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.3" id="not-my-job-task-scope"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Not My Job: Task Scope</h2>
<p>If you ask someone for help on a task that benefits your team, that
person might respond that the task is "not my job" and explain that time
spent on tasks like what you're asking for gets in the way of their
progress. The emotionally engaging work is not that task.</p>
<p>This recurring pattern is sufficiently common that at least one
domain has jargon for the concept. '<a
href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scut">Scut</a>' is
slang in the medical field for the non-clinical yet essential tasks that
do not require a doctor's degree or expertise. Another label used for
non-expert tasks is administrivia (short for administrative tasks).</p>
<p>A mindset related to the "not my job" view is the following. "Once I
realized someone else has the same problem, I stopped worrying about
it." The separation of scope can be reasonable (no point in duplicating
effort) but may cause harm (when there's no coordination). The "not my
job" refusal is about the task being outside the scope of a role.</p>
<p>The potential reasons for this reluctance to help include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Working on the task will not get them promoted.</p></li>
<li><p>Their understanding of the scope of their job and their expertise
does not include the task.</p></li>
<li><p>The person doesn't know how to do the task and they don't want to
learn.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, engaging with the individual refusing to help isn't
usually productive. If you perceive that progress is crucial and is
blocked by this person you can escalate the request up the chain of
command to get a determination about whether the collaboration should
happen. A person who holds the "not my job" may need clarification of
what the scope of their role is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Asking for help and giving (or refusing to give) help is dependent on
your reputation. The next section discusses how you can manage your
reputation in a bureaucratic context.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.4"
id="building-managing-and-spending-reputation"><span
class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Building, Managing, and
Spending Reputation<span id="sec:reputation"
label="sec:reputation"></span></h2>
<p>Within a bureaucratic organization the interaction of bureaucrats is
based on both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo">quid
pro quo</a> and coercion (e.g., sanctions). Good news: you have some
input on your reputation, and that influences how other people engage
with you.</p>
<p>This section is about actions you can take to create a reputation.
Even if you don't intentionally build a reputation, you still get one
because you interact with other people. Also in this section: how to
spend political capital -- both yours and that of your team.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="relevance-of-reputation-in-a-bureaucracy">Relevance of Reputation in
a Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you may want to be all things to all people. Since
that is not feasible, you have to limit your scope and therefore
disappoint some people. This same dynamic of a limited scope applies to
the team you are on, and again to the organization the team is part of.
The purpose of a bureaucratic team or bureaucratic organization is to
manage a <span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span> for a
community. The community members will invariably be disappointed because
access to the shared resource is limited.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can influence how others perceive your
limitations. Their perception of your value is shaped by your investment
in relationships and by your creative negotiations with other
bureaucrats.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="definition-of-reputation">Definition of
Reputation</h3>
<p>Your <span data-acronym-label="reputation"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">reputation</span> as a bureaucrat is
what other people expect from you. Reputation is perception. What does
that person think of you? Your team? Your organization? Reputation is
set whenever and wherever you are observed, or artifacts are associated
with you. What you wear matters to how you are perceived. When you show
up alters your reputation. How your written communication is read alters
perceptions. People are informed by your body posture in meetings.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="reputation-brand-image">Reputation, Brand,
Image</h3>
<p>There are multiple phrases that all refer to the same concept of
being perceived and generating associated expectations. Individuals
create (or get) a reputation; organizations have brands. A team of
bureaucrats can have a reputation.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="your-reputation-matters">Your Reputation
matters</h3>
<p>Your reputation within the organization dramatically alters your
effectiveness. People will let you do things (or prevent you from doing
things) based on their expectations of you.</p>
<p>Your reputation alters your influence. Whether other people turn to
you for input depends on what they expect from you. How others perceive
you impacts what you can accomplish and when people seek your help or
input.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="you-can-manage-your-reputation">You can
Manage your Reputation</h3>
<p>Managing reputation means acknowledging that your interaction with
others is partially performative. This may feel disappointing if you
want to be judged solely on your productivity or knowledge.</p>
<p>Your success is limited if you focus exclusively on doing the work,
and your success is limited if you focus exclusively on performative
aspects. Neglecting to manage your reputation means you lose input to
the stories others tell about you. Active management of your reputation
requires engaging with people and generating evidence.</p>
<p>Your reputation is dynamically changing based on your activities and
communication. Your communication matters, and the stories other people
tell about you matter.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="techniques-for-building-reputational-capital">Techniques for
Building Reputational Capital</h3>
<p>Ideally, your reputation would be based on your technical skills,
your ability to collaborate with other people, the strength of your
network, and your creativity. None of those matters if the person you're
engaging with doesn't know those things. You build your reputation by
doing things that are useful contributions, are visible to other people,
and are associated with you (or your team or organization). This
positive association is what you are creating.</p>
<p>Because the definition of reputation is about expectations other
people have about you, what you choose to work on matters. How you work
on your tasks (creativity, enthusiasm, dedication), the artifacts
produced, and your ability to communicate all shape your reputation.</p>
<p>When building your reputation, you can work on multiple small wins or
take larger risks on bigger bets. The bigger bets provide faster
leverage of reputational capital as you have shown your worthiness and
skill.</p>
<p>The same concepts apply to teams of bureaucrats and bureaucratic
organizations. Just as people compete for resources, teams compete for
budget, staffing, and glory. How the team's budget and staffing are
spent informs reputation.</p>
<p>A specific technique for building a good reputation is <a
href="#sec:credit-others">giving others credit</a>. This may seem
counter-intuitive if you are focused on assignment of credit. What
matters is that other people observe you (whether directly or
indirectly) giving credit.</p>
<p>Similarly, another technique for building good reputation is offering
to <a href="#sec:take-blame">take blame</a>. Again, this can seem
counter-intuitive since being blamed doesn't sound good. The value is in
proclaiming your willingness to be blamed such that other people observe
your offer.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="using-good-news-or-early-news-to-increase-influence">Using Good News
(or Early News) to Increase Influence</h3>
<p>Rather than tell good news directly to a top-level decision-maker,
first inform the person who influences the decision-maker. You can tell
the influencer the information does not need to be credited to
yourself.</p>
<p>The benefits of this approach include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improves the influencer's reputation with the
decision-maker.</p></li>
<li><p>The influencer can contextualize the information for the
decision-maker.</p></li>
<li><p>The influencer can leverage the information in ways you would not
have.</p></li>
<li><p>Your reputation with the influencer is enhanced.</p></li>
<li><p>You reaffirm the influencer's role and status.</p></li>
<li><p>Influencers can be easier to access than
decision-makers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-spend-reputation">How to Spend
Reputation</h3>
<p>Based on your reputation (what the other person expects of you), what
trust does that person have in you? You can then use that trust to do
things that might not otherwise be feasible. You can spend your
reputation to bend rules.</p>
<p>Reputation is not the only thing you can spend as a bureaucrat. Other
examples include your time (up to your entire career), your ability to
be a member of the team or organization, your self-respect, and your
ability to be promoted or receive bonuses. At the level of the team and
the organization, additional aspects to spend are budget and staff. Each
of these (reputation, time, membership, budget, staffing) are potential
investments.</p>
<p>To build or improve reputation you have to spend something. When
considering what to spend account for your personal boundaries. Things
you might not want to spend include your integrity and your health
(physical, mental, emotional). Similar boundaries apply at the team and
organization levels -- trust in the team, the well-being of team
members.</p>
<p>Whenever you engage within your team, you are either actively
spending or building your reputation within the team. Whenever you are
engaging with people from outside your team, you are either actively
spending or building your team's reputation. Spending reputation means
taking risks that involve other people.</p>
<p>Whether for your reputation or that of your team or organization, be
careful to get a return on the investment. Examples of spending
reputation and not adding value:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ask for a favor and provide no value.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore options that other people don't see as worthwhile and
then, after investing, find there's no benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>Produce nothing of value to the organization or other
people.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk with people outside your team and misrepresent the efforts
of your team.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak honestly about the faults of your team to people outside
your team.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reputation management shouldn't be an exclusive motive since your
autonomy can become limited by accounting for how other people perceive
you. How much reputation matters varies from person to person, but
having awareness of the concept and potential consequence of your
effectiveness is helpful. The next section is another variation on
thinking about how other people think.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.5" id="intellectual-empathy"><span
class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Intellectual Empathy<span
id="sec:intellectual-empathy"
label="sec:intellectual-empathy"></span></h2>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you will work with people who are smarter on a
specific topic than you are. That superior knowledge might come from
experience or formal education.</p>
<p>The person with superior knowledge may be able to convey their
knowledge to you, or they may struggle to. That struggle could be due to
an inability to break down complex insights, or they don't recognize the
mismatch between what they know and what you understand. This same
scenario can be reversed -- you might be more knowledgeable on a given
topic than some other bureaucrat you work with. In either situation,
both parties have responsibilities for <span
data-acronym-label="intellectual empathy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">intellectual empathy</span>. The more
knowledgeable person needs to understand what they can build on when
talking with the less knowledgeable person, and the less knowledgeable
person has to be clear about what makes sense and what does not.</p>
<p>You can start conversations with people who are new to you by asking
about their professional background -- their education, past work
experience, and other aspects that would allow you to build on their
existing knowledge. This allows you to tailor the conversation to the
gap of knowledge that exists when discussing a challenge.</p>
<p>During a conversation you can monitor body language for reactions
like a squint, a head tilt, an eyebrow raise or an eyebrow furrowed.
Those are common reactions when information doesn't conform to what the
listener expected.</p>
<p>You can ask about the other person's knowledge of the topic. The
phrasing "Do you know about (name of topic)?" is less effective than
"What do you know about (name of topic)?" Respondents might claim
experience or knowledge of a topic, but probing for the difference
between "I've heard those words before" versus "I was part of a team
that implemented (topic)" versus "I came up with the original idea for
(topic)" is helpful.</p>
<p>Sometimes the person with less knowledge on a topic feels
uncomfortable with indicating their confusion, or sometimes the person
doesn't realize they are missing the main point. The more knowledgeable
person can check in with the listener to confirm. "What did you get from
what I just talked about?" is a better confirmation than "You understood
what I meant, right?" The person with less knowledge can proactively
check their knowledge by providing a read-back: "Here's what I
understood you to mean:..." These check-ins, regardless of who
initiates, should be relatively frequent when exploring complex
topics.</p>
<p>Admitting ignorance can be intimidating and may feel like you risk
losing the other person's respect. A gentler way of saying "I'm lost" is
"I was following up until the point where you described..." Intellectual
empathy is the responsibility of both parties in a conversation.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.6" id="leveraging-expertise"><span
class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Leveraging Expertise<span
id="sec:expertise" label="sec:expertise"></span></h2>
<p>The definition of <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is the management
of shared resources on behalf of a community. In addition to tangible
shared resources like land, water, and air, an intangible resource
accessed by a community is expertise. Bureaucrats are responsible for
finding people with expertise, vetting claims of expertise, and
deploying expertise for the benefit of a community.</p>
<p>Experts who accumulate knowledge and experience look for ways to
apply their expertise. Finding the relevant decision-makers and
providing context for decisions can feel satisfying when positive
outcomes benefit a community.</p>
<p>The following two sections address both viewpoints: that of a
bureaucrat seeking expert help, and that of an expert providing input.
Bridging the cultural divide and knowledge gap in both directions is
necessary for the success of an organization.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="non-experts-seeking-experts">Non-experts
seeking Experts</h3>
<p>Before you seek the help of an expert, your first instinct may be to
try and proceed on your own. <em>How hard could this be? Looks
straightforward enough...</em> That do-it-myself approach is a plateau
you can remain on for an entire career. Or perhaps you encounter
difficulties and realize your limitations. You may seek help from a
local peer. Seeking help from those around you is a second plateau that
may suffice for the issue you're responding to. When local knowledge is
inadequate you need an expert.</p>
<p>Finding an expert can be difficult to distinguish from talking with
non-experts who know something you don't. If you decide a challenge
requires skills you don't have, anyone with those skills has more
expertise than you. Expertise is relative.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="finding-experts">Finding Experts</h4>
<p>One reason you as a bureaucrat seek an expert is you don't have
expertise yourself. (If your motivation is merely to seek an external
scapegoat that can be blamed, then getting any expert that appears
convincing will suffice.)</p>
<p>A technique for finding a relevantly qualified expert is to
triangulate. Seek guidance from your existing social network. Multiple
referrals from independent parties are a positive indicator. That is not
the same as vetting the person's claimed expertise.</p>
<p>Once you've identified a potential expert, you'll need to evaluate
their expertise and the ability to collaborate. This is inherently
difficult since you lack the expertise you are seeking.</p>
<p>Do people defer to the candidate because of the candidate's title,
the candidate's position in the hierarchy, the candidate's experience,
or the candidate's knowledge of technical details? Those can each
qualify someone as an expert, but the title and position are least
connected with expertise. Even experience can be misleading: ten years
of doing a job can sometimes mean just doing the same first-year
activities for ten years. Evaluating an expert's depth of insight is
often relegated to peers in the same field.</p>
<p>When signaled solely by credentials, expertise is independent of
experience. Another risk is that the expert may lack the ability to
communicate their knowledge with people outside their domain.</p>
<p>Within an area of expertise there may be sub-disciplines that you are
not familiar with. Don't be embarrassed to ask the expert you find what
subfield they have experience in, and their evaluation of how well that
aligns with the effort you're recruiting them for.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="communicating-with-experts">Communicating
with Experts</h4>
<p>A common barrier to successful collaboration is the use of jargon by
experts. Jargon can serve two purposes: to signal group membership
(which is harmful to people outside the group), and to be more precise
about a concept (a desirable trait). A pseudo-expert may use jargon
relevant to a topic but not be able to explain the concept to you. That
can be indistinguishable from someone who does know but explains
poorly.</p>
<p>If you're tackling a complex challenge, you may need experts from
different disciplines. This introduces added challenges of
cross-discipline communication.</p>
<p>As a way of distinguishing people who know more than you do, consider
the following levels of expertise.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A self-designated expert is unfamiliar with domain-specific
jargon.</p></li>
<li><p>A pseudo-expert can use jargon in discussion but cannot expand
the definition or provide analogs.</p></li>
<li><p>A pseudo-expert has memorized definitions and can use analogies
but doesn't grasp underlying relations and principles. Boundaries of
what to apply where are uncertain.</p></li>
<li><p>An expert can map the situation-of-interest to underlying
relations and principles, then use that mapping to remedy the issue (or
explain why a fix is infeasible). The result works and the solution
wasn't obvious to non-experts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For bureaucrats seeking to leverage experts, there is the confusing
use of caveats. People who don't have a depth of knowledge are more
likely to be overconfident, while people who do have expertise are
cautious about including caveats and limitations.<a href="#fn30"

<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="for-experts-looking-to-help-non-expert-decision-makers">For Experts
Looking to Help Non-expert Decision-makers</h3>
<p>Providing help to decision-makers can be an emotionally rewarding
application of your skills. The interaction with bureaucrats can also
feel devastating when you aren't listened to, you aren't understood, or
your input is perverted in ways you didn't want. Identify strengths your
audience has and build on those.</p>
<p>You, the expert, may not win any debates based on the number of years
of experience. Some audiences may have many years in the field. However,
expertise (rather than experience) is what they can benefit from.</p>
<p>To establish boundaries on advice-giving, identify areas in which you
have specialized knowledge and which areas the non-expert audience has
insights that you do not. Respect and account for the expertise of the
audience (especially when they work in a different field). Acknowledge
your limits and account for their limits.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on providing expertise as a single-dimensional
relation, find ways to relate personally to audience members. The
purpose of creating and maintaining a personal relationship is necessary
because they will need to trust you.</p>
<p>When you have multiple people seeking to learn from your expertise
you don't have to teach the group all at once. You can provide
one-on-one teaching in which the audience may feel less worried about
asking dumb questions. Once you've taught more than one person, they can
help each other translate the insights.</p>
<p>Being the sole subject matter expert in an organization can feel
isolating. You are constantly educating others, but the stakeholders are
not expected to become your peers. Typically stakeholders want to know
just enough to make a decision.</p>
<p>When there are no other experts locally available who you can ask
questions of, turning to membership in professional organizations is an
option.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is a risk that your expertise is crucial to the
decision-maker. That dependence can result in you thinking that you are
important, but it also means the decision-maker will be less successful
if you are unavailable. You should invest in cultivating your
replacement.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.7" id="does-anyone-want-to-volunteer"><span
class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Does Anyone Want to
Volunteer?</h2>
<p>Bureaucracy relies on coordination to facilitate the management of
shared resources. In the course of coordination, new tasks arise that
have no one person responsible. The word volunteer has two meanings in
this setting: contributing without seeking financial gain, and choosing
to contribute of your own free will. The focus here is on the second
meaning.</p>
<p>When the facilitator of a meeting asks the group, "Does anyone want
to volunteer for this task?" the question is often met with silence. No
one wants extra work that does not help them, even if there is benefit
to the team or organization. The lack of response is an instance of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy
of the commons</a>, but in an anticipatory sense. Instead of asking this
poorly-framed question, the facilitator can get higher engagement with
the following tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ask each person in the meeting whether they are attending to
passively observe or to participate.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person willing to participate how much time they can
invest. Responses could be zero hours, one hour (non-recurring), one
hour per month, or something else.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what their goals in the interaction are. It is
usually generic ("I want the group to succeed.") but it can be narrow,
in which case that gives you something to focus on.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what they are good at and what skills they have.
Are they good with personal interaction? Writing? Computers?
Coordinating? Logistics? Fundraising? Making phone calls?</p></li>
<li><p>From the inventory of tasks, are there any that fit both the
skills and time? Can the task be scoped to fit the time? If there are
multiple candidate tasks for a volunteer, let them pick the task. (If no
existing task aligns with their skills, do not create work to be
assigned.)</p></li>
<li><p>If other people are working on the same task, put the volunteer
in contact with the other people.</p></li>
<li><p>Give the volunteer a deadline for the task. Your deadline should
not be arbitrary -- it should be based on the task dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that the volunteer is willing to commit the time to
complete the tasks by the deadline.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule a check-in with the volunteer before the task deadline
to review progress.</p></li>
<li><p>To create accountability among multiple volunteers, hold a group
review to explain how each participant's work contributes to the goals
and how work done by one person enables the next task done by someone
else. (Enumerate the dependency graph; include deadlines.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As the facilitator looking to designate tasks to participants, the
above tactics align the work with the skills of contributors.</p>
<p>As a contributor, your obligations to the team are knowing how much
time you have to contribute and being clear about the relative
priorities of tasks. Explaining that the new task is lower priority than
all your other obligations is a valid response. Your responsibility is
to negotiate with the person looking to assign new work and the people
who depend on the results of your current tasks.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.1"
id="communication-is-critical-for-bureaucracy"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Communication is Critical for
Bureaucracy<span id="sec:critical-communication"
label="sec:critical-communication"></span></h2>
<p>Decentralized bureaucracy relies on distributed knowledge and
distributed decision-making. Distributed decision-making relies on
effective communication. Bureaucrats communicate by writing and
speaking; both methods convey incomplete information and are imprecise.
The inability to communicate comprehensively and precisely means
iteration is helpful when establishing a shared mental model of the
situation and plan.</p>
<p>The dependence on iterative interactions means relationships matter
for communication. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metcalfe's law</a>
says the value of an organization is proportional to the square of the
number of people interacting in the organization. A team of 5 people is
not just the aggregated skills of five individuals -- there's the synergy
arising from ten bilateral relationships. Broadening your network of
collaborators increases your potential effectiveness and, symmetrically,
the reach of your fellow bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Suppose that you don't invest in relationships with your fellow
bureaucrats. Then you'll be less likely to know what is happening in
your organization, and you won't understand why certain decisions were
made. Your confusion might lead you to focus on your interests since
that is what you have some control over and insight into. Being selfish
doesn't leverage the potential synergy of collaboration, but at least
you look busy.</p>
<p>The analysis above applies to each person in the bureaucratic
organization. The consequence is that the organization's goals are not
achieved when bureaucrats act independently. There is a way out of this:
broadcast your intent to other people, be transparent with decisions,
and share the results of your activities. That decreases the confusion
other people may have about your actions and can improve everyone's
effectiveness. You can make yourself and the organization more effective
even when your investment in communication is not reciprocated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Information within a bureaucracy shapes the relationships among
bureaucrats. You have a choice: you can decide to not share information,
you can be transparent, or you can be vulnerable. Not sharing
information can harm or protect relationships. Being transparent conveys
"here's what is happening." Being vulnerable expands transparency to
explain "here's why that's happening or what might happen." Each of
those options informs how your coworkers, peers, management, and team
members interpret their perception of your intent. Your communication
shapes your <a href="#sec:reputation">reputation</a>.</p>
<p>Another way communication alters bureaucratic organizations is when
actions informed by locally available information produce <a
href="#sec:failure-to-comm">suboptimal results for participants</a>, as
illustrated by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner's
dilemma</a>.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>The <span data-acronym-label="Prisoner&#39;s dilemma"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">Prisoner's dilemma</span> describes
the following scenario. Two people suspected of a crime are held by
police. The suspects are not allowed to communicate with each other. The
suspects can either both remain silent (and be jailed for 1 year), one
testifies against the other (in which case the silent person goes to
jail for 3 years), or both testify and each goes to jail for 2
years.</p>
<p>Each suspect would select the testimony (resulting in betrayal) to
minimize their imprisonment even though there's a better option of
remaining silent since each suspect cannot predict the behavior of the
other person. <span id="prisoners_dilemma_explanation"
label="prisoners_dilemma_explanation"></span></p>
</div>
<p>As with suspects in the Prisoner's Dilemma scenario, bureaucrats
rarely have access to the holistic view of their organization.
Bureaucrats have a narrow view of their team and interfaces to adjacent
teams. The concept of "locally available information" applies to
communication among bureaucrats that facilitates delegation of work,
allocation of resources, relationship creation/maintenance, and carrying
out processes.</p>
<p>If having a holistic view yields better results, why not just do that
instead of relying on local information? Each bureaucrat benefits from
gathering information that shapes their actions, but communication has a
cost: time spent building and verifying consensus delays action. You get
fewer things done when you spend time talking with people. That
trade-off of not being able to do everything well is called an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity
cost</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The explanations above show that communication is critical for
bureaucracy and essential for being an effective bureaucrat.
Communication occurs between two or more people, but before getting to
that you need to improve your <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapersonal_communication">inner
monologue</a>.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.2"
id="communication-reflects-and-shapes-your-thinking"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Communication Reflects and
Shapes Your Thinking</h2>
<p>Before you talk to another person, you have an internal dialog about
how to interpret events and what you think will happen in the future.
Your inner monologue shapes your expectations and your actions. When you
talk with fellow bureaucrats, you're sharing some of your thoughts and
allowing their thoughts to shape your contemplation.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you might have a few complaints you've thought about
regarding your team or organization. Complaining about bureaucracy is a
common way for bureaucrats to bond. Complaints occasionally lead to
insights, but that's typically not the goal.</p>
<p>By changing how you think about the challenges you face, you can
alter your perception and your reputation. As an example of this change,
can you turn complaints into impact statements? The following examples
show how to spin a negative experience. Providing a solution isn't
required in this exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Negative observation</em>: "Logging into my computer takes a long
time."<br />
<em>Positive statement with explanation of impact</em>: "If I were able
to log into my computer more quickly, then I could do more tasks."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Negative observation</em>: "I need support from a team that doesn't
offer a way to track the status of my request."<br />
<em>Positive statement with explanation of impact</em>: "If the service
team I need support from offered a way to track requests, then I would
be able to know the status of my request."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Negative observation</em>: "When I submit a support request to the
team, I don't have visibility on the status of the request."<br />
<em>Positive statement with explanation of impact</em>: "If the service
team I need support from offered visibility into their tracking of
tasks, then I could proceed with other tasks knowing my request wasn't
lost."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Sharing negativity is a way of commiserating, but it doesn't indicate to
other people that you're adding value. When you notice a complaint, can
you frame it as describing why the issue matters?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Another framing that harms your thinking and how you communicate is the
use of generalizations. Personifying other teams and organizations is a
simpler-to-understand and simpler-to-describe model, though the
simplification is often incorrect.</p>
<p>Here's a progression that shows how to transform generalizations into
action:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This organization does not like blueberry pie.</p></li>
<li><p>No one in this organization likes blueberry pie.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know of anyone in the organization who likes blueberry
pie.</p></li>
<li><p>I like blueberry pie. How would I find someone else in the
organization who wants blueberry pie?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first statement personifies the organization. Organizations
cannot like or dislike tangible items, so that statement is meaningless.
The second statement is slightly more precise (each person can have
likes and dislikes) though still a generalization and therefore likely
inaccurate. Did you confirm with every member of the organization that
they do not like blueberry pie? The source of the generalization might
be your lack of relationships with every member of the organization.
That leads to the fourth statement which is correct, precise, and
curious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Now that you've reflected on how your internal dialog alters your
perceptions and actions, the next section describes how communication
goes wrong.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.3" id="failure-to-communicate"><span
class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Failure to Communicate<span
id="sec:failure-to-comm" label="sec:failure-to-comm"></span></h2>
<p>Communication among bureaucrats, policymakers, and subjects is
critical because <span data-acronym-label="decentralized bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">decentralized bureaucracy</span>
relies on distributed knowledge and distributed decision-making. When
less effective communication occurs, individual bureaucrats are less
able to rely on the knowledge of other experts, and they have to make
decisions with less consensus.</p>
<p>This section on failure outlines how ineffective communication
happens. Identifying generic sources of difficulty is intended to help
you distinguish what is common in bureaucratic organizations versus what
is specific to the people you collaborate with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Sometimes failure to communicate is caused by too much ineffective
communication. You can get overwhelmed when there is a lot of
communication happening (whether from too many sources or too much
content). Feeling saturated with meetings, emails, phone calls, and
other coordination may stem from ineffective communication.
Communication that is incorrect, imprecise, redundant, and insufficient
can be improved. Improvement in communication effectiveness is more than
just a time saver -- poor communication yields poor negotiation. When
negotiations are not going well, the interaction defaults to an
emotional struggle of willpower.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="why-written-communication-does-not-happen">Why written communication
does not happen<span id="sec:written-comm-does-not-happen"
label="sec:written-comm-does-not-happen"></span></h3>
<p>Written communication is important in bureaucratic interactions
because an objective record is created. Besides the author and reader
referencing the content, other people can review who said what when.
This accountability can be a benefit or risk depending on what you're
doing. Writing takes skill and time, so the investment is rare compared
to talking on the phone, over video calls, or in-person.</p>
<p>If you can identify specific causes of why communication isn't
happening, then you can intervene and address the concerns other
bureaucrats may have. The following list is a set of common reasons that
you can remedy by developing a workaround or by discussing the issue
explicitly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are too many reports, emails, and messages to read,
process, and respond to. As a result, bureaucrats feel emotionally and
cognitively overwhelmed.</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat receiving information may read slowly. A slower
processing rate has ripple effects for coworkers and subjects.</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat-as-author may type slowly, or their handwriting is
poor. Applying your Process Empathy, imagine how the person may feel and
how they might cope.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential participants fear imperfect communication. What if the
email is incomplete, inaccurate, or ambiguous? Their perception is that
imperfect communication is a risk to reputation. How can you help
address these fears? Are the fears based on specific reference
experiences?</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat views written communication as "official" or "plan
of record" and feels uncomfortable brainstorming or creating contingency
plans.</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat wants to avoid accountability for their
statements. How will you practice Process Empathy in your
interactions?</p></li>
<li><p>The bureaucrat may not be confident in their writing ability --
spelling, grammar, sentence composition, and structuring content. (These
skills can be improved through intentional investment using self-study
or directed coursework.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you can identify why written communication is not happening, you
can work with the other people involved to develop creative
solutions.</p>
<p>Another source of challenge for written communication is the latency
of asynchronous interactions. By labeling distinct types of delay, you
are better equipped to respond when the issue arises.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="slowing-communication">Slowing
Communication<span id="sec:slowing-communication"
label="sec:slowing-communication"></span></h3>
<p>In an ideal scenario there would be no delay associated with
communication -- you would get the information you need when you need it.
In practice, there are various causes for why your progress is blocked
when you depend on other people.</p>
<p>Tactics that delay communication within a bureaucratic organization
include stonewalling, slow-rolling, bikeshedding, and red herrings. By
learning these concepts you will be better able to identify and then
respond to instances of their use.</p>
<p>Stonewalling is when the recipient of a request or question doesn't
reply. There may be <a href="#sec:email-responsiveness">legitimate
reasons for the lack of response</a>. The person may be busy and didn't
see your message, or they did see your message but didn't have a chance
to reply yet because a response to you is lower priority than other
tasks they have. You cannot differentiate those reasonable causes from
when the recipient doesn't want to enable you to proceed. They may
disagree with your objective and see silence as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive-aggressive_behavior">less
confrontational</a> than explicit rejection.</p>
<p>One way of circumventing stonewalling is to ask if the respondent is
opposed to your idea. Then a lack of response indicates no opposition.
This tactic works best when you are confident the recipient will read or
hear the message.</p>
<p>An unintentional source of stonewalling is when you ask on the wrong
channel. Sending an email may result in what appears to be stonewalling
if the person relies on chat messages or the phone. The solution for
this is feasible, but action is required by the person who doesn't
respond. The person who only uses certain channels should explicitly
indicate that. An automatic out-of-office email that says, "Contact me
by phone" tells the sender the <a
href="#sec:communication-preferences">preferred channel</a>.</p>
<p>From the view of the person doing the stonewalling, if you need time
to think or gather information before responding, tell the person who
sent a request that you acknowledge their message and will follow up in
more detail later (with a specific timeline). While better than no
response, this leads to the next challenge.</p>
<p>Slow-rolling is when you get a response to your request or question,
but the response isn't helpful. Progress is delayed because you have to
iterate to get an answer. There are valid reasons for a slow-roll and
there are malicious reasons for a slow-roll response. Perhaps the person
wants to acknowledge your request but doesn't currently have time to
provide a full explanation. The person may need to gather more
information for the complete response. Or the person is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive-aggressive_behavior">passive-aggressive</a>
and may understand your question but does not want to enable your
progress.</p>
<p>The reason for a slow-roll should be made explicit by the respondent,
and a timeline for a complete response is helpful.</p>
<p><span id="concept:bikeshedding"
label="concept:bikeshedding"></span></p>
<p>Bikeshedding is when the recipient of a question or request <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">focuses on
unimportant details relative to the primary topic</a>. Whether this
behavior is intentional or not, the best response is to refocus the
conversation on the core issue. The amount of time allocated for various
topics should be proportional to their consequence.</p>
<p>A <span data-acronym-label="red herring"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">red herring</span> response is
misleading, whether intentional or not. The respondent provides what
looks like a reasonable answer but results in unproductive work.
Occasionally there is a coincidental benefit of discovering something
unexpected, but that wasn't the respondent's intent.</p>
<p>Even though bikeshedding and a red herring can be <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">dark patterns</a>,
that may not be the intent of the speaker or author. Perception matters
more than intent. Process Empathy applies both when you are sharing
information (how could the information be perceived?) and when you are
receiving information (what was the author's intent?).</p>

<em>Challenge</em>: Periodic status reports sent up the chain of command
get sanitized so that only good news is shared. The removal of "bad"
information impedes risk analysis.<br />
<em>Tactic</em>: If your reports are getting sanitized, ask for a copy
of the sanitized version. If you have the responsibility for
consolidating and aggregating reports, aim for conciseness and context
rather than good news.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Challenge</em>: Decisions by bureaucrats high in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy">chain of
command</a> are not explained to members lower in the hierarchy.<br />
<em>Tactic</em>: You can request management provide a summary of their
activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Challenge</em>: To assume makes an ass out of you and me, yet
assumptions are necessary to making progress in communication.<br />
<em>Tactic</em>: You can address this dissonance by looking for sources
of difference and then talking about them. For example, when you first
talk with someone you can ask what their educational background is. You
can tune your language to their academic training if they have a
different degree than yours. You can make your story more relatable.</p>
<p><em>Tactic</em>: Another technique for detecting differences is to
ask about the person's previous experience. What did they work on
previously in this organization? What were their jobs before joining
this organization? This backstory can provide context for decisions that
need to be made in the current context.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="disrupting-the-path-to-failure">Disrupting
the Path to Failure</h3>
<p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner's
dilemma</a> is a scenario in which two participants have conflicting
objectives and are unable to coordinate. Each participant has to guess
what another person in their position might do. An inability to
coordinate leads to suboptimal conclusions. For bureaucrats in similar
conditions, options include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expose all participants to the consequence of outcomes. In
practice, this feels unfair to each participant because the outcome is
partially attributable to other people involved in the process. Dividing
responsibility limits exposure to consequences.</p></li>
<li><p>Have all participants communicate. In practice, communication
takes time and skill. Not everyone is willing to invest since
communication is not seen as "doing the task." The farther apart people
are from each other spatially, the more effort is required to
communicate. (The relation of spatial locality with communication is
characterized by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve">Allen curve</a>.)</p>
<p>The time needed to arrive through consensus at an optimal approach
for a given situation may exceed the time available for addressing the
challenge.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit everything to what can be done by one person. This
hero-based approach is limited to the person's attention-bandwidth and
skills. As the complexity increases, the necessary skills increase and
the number of candidate heroes decreases. Large organizations carry out
complicated tasks by leveraging diverse skills of teams of
bureaucrats.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing the Prisoner's Dilemma that is rampant within
organizations depends on recognizing the issue and identifying possible
fixes. You will likely have to invest effort beyond what other
bureaucrats are doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The multitude of potential causes of communication failure is made more
complicated by the myriad ways individuals prefer to communicate. The
next section provides an example of why a bureaucrat might prefer one
channel over another.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.4" id="communication-preferences"><span
class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Communication Preferences<span
id="sec:communication-preferences"
label="sec:communication-preferences"></span></h2>
<p>There are typically multiple communication channels available between
bureaucrats in an organization. Rather than focus on specific
implementations using specific technologies, consider two variables. The
first variable is asynchronous versus synchronous. Examples of
asynchronous communication channels include voice mail, email, web
forums, websites, and calendars. Synchronous options include phone
calls, video calls, in-person, text-based chat like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)">Slack</a>. The
distinction between asynchronous and synchronous can be blurred, like if
someone immediately replies to your (asynchronous) email. The second
variable is a set of categories: voice (e.g., phone), text (e.g.,
website, web forums, calendars), video (e.g., calls), and in-person.</p>
<p>The two variables above are characterized by latency (how much delay)
and bandwidth (how much content per unit time). Any communication
technology, platform, or service is characterized by latency and
bandwidth.</p>
<p>When a communication channel has less bandwidth, there is a loss of
ability to interpret intent. For example, consider audio that has been
converted to text. In addition to the text transcription, voice audio
has inflection, volume, volume variation, rate, and rate variance. Those
aspects help the audience understand the speaker better, improving the
effectiveness of communication.</p>
<p>The relevance to a bureaucrat of identifying these channels is to
know which channel is preferred for what purpose. You can list your
preferences so that people know how best to engage with you. Second, you
can learn and then leverage the preferences of people you collaborate
with.</p>
<p>As an example of knowing your behaviors, do you keep your calendar
up-to-date? Or is your calendar irrelevant? Is that preference stated
explicitly to the people who might reference your calendar? Is your
calendar visible to your coworkers?</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p><em>The following illustrates when to use which channel for what
purpose, and in what order.</em></p>
<p>Text chat is useful for asynchronous interrupts. Text chats are
better than stopping by in person or calling on the phone since
in-person drive-bys and phone calls interrupt whatever I'm thinking
about or discussing. The purpose of the text chat is either a reminder
or to find a convenient time to talk.</p>
<p>Email is useful for notifications or questions or setting up
logistics. If I don't respond to your question or request for action
within two days, please send a reminder.</p>
<p>Video calls are my preferred method for group meetings. Group
meetings via video call scheduled in advance on my calendar are best.
Impromptu video calls are acceptable but as disruptive as a phone
call.</p>
<p>In-person discussions are my preferred method for one-on-one
discussions. Stopping by my desk without an appointment interrupts
whatever I'm thinking about. If a calendar invitation is inconvenient, a
text chat confirming my availability before the in-person discussion is
helpful.</p>
<p>The phone is useful when the caller is unable to be present
in-person. Phone, being voice-only, is inferior to video calls.
Unscheduled phone calls interrupt whatever I'm thinking about. I've
intentionally disabled voicemail.</p>
<p>Status updates in electronic issue trackers, wikis, or forums are
best (rather than email-only). Notifying in text chat or email that a
wiki page or issue is updated is helpful but not mandatory.</p>
<p>Given all those caveats, I prefer communication in any form at any
time over surprises.</p>
<p>If you're unsure whether you should communicate, default to
communicating. If you're not sure whether communication would interrupt
something, check my calendar and then communicate. If it's urgent or
blocking progress, ignore my calendar and interrupt me. <span
id="communication_channel_preferences_example"
label="communication_channel_preferences_example"></span></p>
</div>
<p>You may not have the same prioritization, or you may not have as
detailed preferences. The take-aways from the above example are that you
should know when to switch communication channels. You should know when
to start in one channel and then escalate from text to phone to
in-person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The discussion above of which channel to use is person-specific. While
bureaucracy can seem (and is designed to be) impersonal, being an
effective bureaucrat means tailoring your interactions to the people you
work with. That personalization doesn't have to stray into being
intimate friends; there's a professional capacity for vulnerability.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.5"
id="communicating-a-professional-sense-of-vulnerability"><span
class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Communicating a Professional
Sense of Vulnerability<span id="sec:professional-vulnerability"
label="sec:professional-vulnerability"></span></h2>
<p>Personal emotionally vulnerable communication is a form of intimacy.
You are exposing personal issues to other people. Being emotionally
vulnerable deepens relationships. The risk is that information could be
used to manipulate or harm. Whether you choose to form social
friendships with your coworkers is up to you, but that isn't a
requirement for an effective bureaucrat. However, there is a more
relevant practice of vulnerability.</p>
<p>Professional vulnerability is about going beyond transparency
regarding bureaucratic issues. Transparency is about what is happening,
while professional vulnerability is about why something is happening.
For example, professional topics of conversation include processes and
incentives. Bureaucratic processes may be intended to be impersonal, but
the consequences are felt by participants.</p>
<p>Discussions of internal intrigues of an organization are a form of
gossip among professionals. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip">Gossip</a> can be
constructive (finding aspects to remedy), lead to insights, and shapes
cultural expectations within the bureaucracy. As with personal gossip,
professional gossip can risk harm if used against other organization
members.</p>
<p>As with personal vulnerability, professional vulnerability involves
learning who to share what information with and when. When interacting
with a person who is new to you, you can experiment by being
professionally vulnerable and see whether they reciprocate or at least
explore the topic with you. Being open, direct, and curious can help the
person you're talking with feel more comfortable. Shared introspection
is the objective.</p>
<p>As an example, you can say something like, "Perhaps the reason behind
(observation) is (reason 1) or (reason 2)." That gives the other person
a chance to brainstorm with me without committing to a position. If the
other person is unwilling to explore in-depth, reverting to safer topics
is easy. Being vulnerable does not mean the other person will
reciprocate. That is a risk on your part.</p>
<p>Another tactic for using professional vulnerability is asking for
help. This can be especially effective for engaging with people who you
disagree with or don't like you. Establishing a common goal and a shared
task is a way to collaborate. Alternatively, leveraging a difference in
knowledge can create an opening for vulnerability: state your lack of
skill or insight and ask for the other person's expertise.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.6" id="communication-tips"><span
class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Communication Tips</h2>
<p>The role of verbal and written communication is critical for
bureaucrats. Bureaucracy is distributed knowledge and distributed
decision-making, both of which benefit from effective coordination.</p>
<p>Plenty of advice on effective communication (e.g., enunciate, speak
loud enough to be heard, be humble, be curious) exists; the advice below
is included because of specific relevance within bureaucratic
organizations. However, the following is generic to interactions outside
of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Not all Interaction Challenges are
Communication problems</strong>.<br />
Sometimes an inability to discuss ideas is not a communication problem
but a psychological deficit of personality. Distinguishing "I'm an
ineffective communicator" from "the person I'm talking with doesn't
communicate effectively" from "that person has a diagnosed psychological
reason they are unable to communicate" is tough for those of us who are
not psychologists or psychiatrists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Avoid relying on
stereotypes</strong>.<br />
Within an organization, different teams may build up reputations for
certain behaviors, or there may be significant events that the team is
associated with. When interacting with members of a team that has a
reputation, avoid relying on that stereotype or event as an opening for
discussion. You're speaking to a person, so discuss that person's
behavior with them. Be curious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Avoid questions that have a binary
response<span id="sec:yes-no-questions"
label="sec:yes-no-questions"></span></strong>.<br />
Responding "no" to a request benefits the person replying to the
question. The person answering "no" then has less work required, less
risk of failure, and better continuity with previous activities. As an
example of a poorly framed question, you could ask, "Can I have a copy
of the data you're using?" The person you're asking is less disrupted if
they refuse to share.</p>
<p>A more constructive phrasing is, "I need information on X to work on
Y, and I think you have information about X. How can you help me get
information on X?" By clarifying your intent, you allow the person with
the data to provide options you may not have considered.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you're being asked for information, try to learn the
person's intent motivating the question. Sometimes the requester doesn't
know what to ask for. Instead of "no" try to figure out how to enable
the person to be successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Leverage the other person's
experience while focusing on your own<span id="sec:advice"
label="sec:advice"></span></strong>.<br />
Advice without context is less effective.<br />
<em>Bad</em>: "Here is what I think you should do in that
situation."<br />
<em>Better</em>: "Here is what I did in that situation."</p>
<p>People usually find talking about themselves an easy topic if you are
curious about their experiences. If you can learn the other person's
background, history, and motivations, you can weave that into the advice
you provide. Tailoring your message increases the likelihood of
implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Avoid Platitudes<span
id="sec:platitudes" label="sec:platitudes"></span></strong>.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platitude">Platitudes</a> are
<span data-acronym-label="thought-terminating"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">thought-terminating</span>; the
statement feels true and is resistant to debate. Platitudes capture a
feeling with enough accuracy, but with imprecise language. As a result,
there's no specific action.</p>
<p>Because platitudes result in a conclusion, the conversation
participants may feel more bonded. However, that bond is shallow.</p>
<p>Example platitudes to avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pick your battles.</p></li>
<li><p>Some things you can't explain.</p></li>
<li><p>Your time will come.</p></li>
<li><p>You can be anything that you want to be.</p></li>
<li><p>I just want to get through this day.</p></li>
<li><p>It is what it is.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm just one person.</p></li>
<li><p>That's that.</p></li>
<li><p>Life's not perfect.</p></li>
<li><p>Life's not fair.</p></li>
<li><p>There's only so much you can do about it.</p></li>
<li><p>What is meant to be will be.</p></li>
<li><p>It is God's will.</p></li>
<li><p>It's part of God's plan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If your goal is to understand a concept or issue deeply, you need to
use precise language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Strive to use Precise
Language</strong>.<br />
Imprecise language causes miscommunication. The speaker's or writer's
intent is unclear, as is the expected consequence. Typically people get
away with imprecise language because their actions are inconsequential.
Only when the consequences matter does the problem of imprecise language
manifest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Tip for Precision</em>: If you have a specific definition for a word
central to the topic of interest, ask your new collaborator for their
definition. Do not expect others to share your definition even when
there are established norms for the topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Tip for Precision</em>: Instead of asking a collaborator, "Are you
taking action on this topic?" ask, "What actions are you taking on this
topic?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Tip for Precision</em>: If someone claims, "We plan to get to that
action," ask for a timeline. A deadline can be for an artifact or a
re-evaluation of the topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Imprecise language takes less cognition to create and can take less time
to convey. Thinking harder about how to precisely convey an idea takes
effort. The importance of precise language is proportional to the
potential consequences of action, inaction, or wrong action. The degree
of precision should be proportional to the complexity of the topic being
discussed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Word is Bond<span
id="sec:word-is-bond" label="sec:word-is-bond"></span></strong>.<br />
Your communication (verbal and written) is your reputation. People rely
on what you tell them even if there isn't legal recourse. Reliance on
your word is why precision matters.</p>
<p>Frustration and disappointment follow when you don't uphold your
word, others misinterpret your imprecise language, or you are
misunderstood.</p>
<p>Communication implies responsibility for the content. There is
corresponding accountability in the relationship between speaker and
listener (or writer and reader).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Take care near the Boundaries of
Knowledge</strong>.<br />
Trying to find someone else's extent of knowledge is tricky -- they don't
want to appear stupid. They may interpret the exploration as a trap. "I
don't know" can be an embarrassing statement to make, even if you don't
share their embarrassment.</p>
<p>Knowing the limitations of your knowledge and disclosing those
boundaries to others is critical. Distinguish what you know from
speculation about things you don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Listen all the way to the last word
of the speaker</strong>.<br />
Formulating a response to the first part of an idea or a sentence is
tempting. Waiting for the speaker to finish before thinking of how to
respond is courteous. Waiting creates a pause which makes you seem more
thoughtful.</p>
<p>This waiting is complicated by speakers who include long pauses for
contemplation and then resume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Stop speaking over other people<span
id="sec:crosstalk" label="sec:crosstalk"></span></strong>.<br />
Crosstalk occurs when two people who are communicating verbally
experience interference from another audible conversation. That can
occur because a third person is talking at one of the original two
participants, or when four or more people are holding two separate
conversations concurrently.</p>
<p>Crosstalk in a bureaucracy can be motivated by the limited time
available to communicate. A meeting participant may feel inspired by
something someone else said and want to interject. Crosstalk can
indicate engagement and enthusiasm, or it can be due to the speaker
wanting to dominate the topic through interruption. The likelihood of
crosstalk is dependent on the level of aggressiveness of participants.
In either case (enthusiasm or power-seeking), the original speakers are
disrespected. The original speaker may feel annoyed at being
interrupted.</p>
<p>The audience is frustrated by the lack of clarity on where to focus.
This distraction causes participants to lose focus, and the productivity
of the interaction decreases.</p>
<p><em>Bystander intervention for an out-of-control meeting</em>: raise
your hand. This non-verbally reverts focus back to the discussion
facilitator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Account for Warnock's
dilemma</strong>.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warnock%27s_dilemma">Warnock's
dilemma</a> is the common experience of figuring out how to interpret
not getting feedback. This is especially vital in meetings where the
speaker or facilitator needs to gauge participant comprehension of
delivered content. Asking, "Does anyone not understand what I just
described?" is likely to get no response from attendees because each
person wants to avoid looking stupid.</p>
<p><em>Technique for getting participation</em>: Pick one person to
provide a recap.</p>
<p><em>Technique for getting participation</em>: Survey the audience
using multiple-choice to gauge understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Seek action with a
Deadline</strong>.<br />
When asking someone for help or input, specify a deadline for their
response. This helps the person rank the urgency of their tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Make Deadlines
Explicit</strong>.</p>
<p>Typically requests have two deadlines. The first deadline is when a
response is sought. The second deadline is when a response is no longer
useful.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose you are inviting people to a meeting. You send
the invitation five days before the meeting and want to know who can
attend by three days before the meeting. The second deadline is the time
of the meeting. Replies after that second deadline do not help you
understand who is going to attend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Identify the cause of
miscommunication</strong>.<br />
Letting miscommunication go uncorrected takes the least amount of work.
Left uncorrected, the same behavior is likely to happen again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Miscommunication can be due to different definitions of words or
differences in context. Confirming definitions once confusion is
identified is a useful first step.</p></li>
<li><p>A speaker may be inarticulate. Sometimes the speaker is unable to
coherently convey their internal experience to a listener.</p></li>
<li><p>A speaker has nothing to say about a subject. Regardless of
whether they are capable of articulating a concept, a person in this
situation still wants to take part but they are unable to meaningfully
contribute.</p></li>
<li><p>Empty talk is the use of words that are ill-defined, emotionally
resonant, unactionable, and impersonal. This is sometimes performative
or can be intended to fill the time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>ask-tell-ask</strong>.<br />
Collaborating with fellow bureaucrats who have expertise in areas you do
not requires extra work. There may be differences in the words used to
describe certain situations, more precision in wording that you're used
to, or thinking about situations in ways you are not familiar with. In
that context, to bridge the differences you can ask, tell, ask&nbsp;<span
class="citation"
data-cites="2014_ask_tell_ask 2012_Beresford">(Excellence in Primary
Care 2014; Beresford 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>The first step is asking what the other person's perspective is on
the topic. This helps establish the right level of nuance and can tell
you how that person frames the issue. The second step is to tell the
person what you want to say. The "tell" step should leverage what you
learned from the first "ask" step. Use phrasing that is consistent with
what you just learned from the other person. The third step is to ask
the person what they heard from you. If they are unable to tell you, you
may need to refine your delivery. To improve the likelihood of success,
keep the content in the second step short.</p>
<p>The ask-tell-ask technique can be used iteratively in the same
conversation, especially when discussing complex topics with a new
collaborator. Using ask-tell-ask takes longer than just telling but
increases the effectiveness of the communication. You also get to learn
more about the other person's perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Initial responsiveness and status
updates</strong>.<br />
Taking action in a bureaucracy may require approval or guidance from
other bureaucrats. If you are the person providing approval or guidance
and immediate determination isn't possible, a response indicating you've
received the request allows the person asking for input to know you are
aware of the request. Sitting on the request (whether intentionally not
responding or because you are busy with other tasks) allows for two
outcomes. The person with the request may give up, or the person seeking
input may ask again. The act of asking again can serve as an indicator
the priority of the task. If you are working towards a determination and
can provide status updates, that helps the person with the request
understand what is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Don't seek Attribution for
Contributions; Credit Others<span id="sec:credit-others"
label="sec:credit-others"></span></strong>.<br />
Give credit to others for good ideas and beneficial actions. Either they
accept credit and you are seen as a contributor to their success, or
they push back and you look generous. Credit is not a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum
game</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Offer to take the Blame<span
id="sec:take-blame" label="sec:take-blame"></span></strong>.<br />
Before an action begins, tell collaborators that you are willing to
accept blame if something goes wrong. This alleviates their fear of
risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Communication Tip</em>: <strong>Survey Stakeholders</strong>.<br />
The following story about digging a well illustrates the challenge of
surveying stakeholders.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>Suppose you are a <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/">Peace
Corps</a> worker in Africa. You show up and the village doesn't have
easy access to clean water. Villagers walk a long distance in dangerous
areas for dirty, unsafe water. This is an obvious problem and all the
villagers agree that they don't have good water and that this problem
should be fixed.</p>
<p>Enacting the solution would take about a week - get the equipment to
the village, drill a well, and build a pump.</p>
<p>You could take more time and involve the villagers in this project.
They could participate in getting the equipment, which should lead to a
sense of ownership. But then when the equipment shows up, they don't
drill the well. If the well is drilled, it soon falls into disrepair and
the villagers are back to doing things the way they used to. What
happened?</p>
<p>The villagers don't see access to clean water as the most significant
issue. You came in and imposed your view of what the problem is and how
to fix it. When you impose your view of what the problem is, the
solution won't be adopted by villagers because they don't prioritize it.
It is better to survey the community to see how they operate. What do
they think the problems are? Community members need to provide
priorities.</p>
<p>This issue is exacerbated if you come to the village as a
representative of a company providing wells. You are biased when you
ask, "Do you have any problems?"</p>
<p>Of course the villagers have water problems which could be fixed with
better wells. However, when you get into the details of placing or
improving a well, they lose interest. What the community wants is free
installation, zero maintenance, easy to use, and no operational costs.
That would improve their lives.</p>
</div>
<p>When you say there's cost (both initial investment of capital and
then operations+maintenance) and a learning curve associated with the
solution, then the user's interest wanes -- you are presenting another
cost/benefit ratio for them to evaluate. Then they ask, "Can we get by
without the well?" Yes, they don't need the well -- they've survived
without it.</p>
<p>Novel solutions (in this example, drilling a well and installing a
pump) have barriers to adoption. Two barriers are the current priorities
of the community and the incumbent solution or processes.</p>
<p>If there are problems with higher priority, the community will delay
enacting your solution. That's fine if the higher-ranked priorities are
bounded, but they are often not. An example of this is the following:
Suppose a person has three tasks, and you introduce a solution which is
a fourth task. If the first task is "go from point A to point B," then
that task will eventually be eliminated and there will be three
remaining. If the second task is "secure your village," that is an
unbounded task. The person won't get to or won't prioritize your
low-ranked task.</p>
<p>How will your solution impact their higher-ranked priorities?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If enacting all these tips sounds like a lot of work, that's because it
is. Effective written communication requires intentional effort because
of the lack of augmenting channels (compared to voice or video or
in-person).</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="summary-of-what-action-should-be-carried-out">Summary of what action
should be carried out</h3>
<p>As the outsider, you should help the community enumerate and document
all of the problems they identify. Then you can help enumerate and
document how the problems are related (dependencies). Only then can you
help the community identify and document the root causes.</p>
<p>If the solution you, the outsider, identified is the root cause, then
the community will arrive at that independently. If that is the case,
then you can enable them to enact a solution that addresses the root
causes. The community will then have a sense of ownership.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.7" id="effective-emails-and-reports"><span
class="header-section-number">6.7</span> Effective Emails and
Reports</h2>
<p>A common misconception is that emails and reports are for
communication. To be more precise, the only true statement you can
surmise from the activity is, "I wrote something." Asynchronous
communication has no requirement for a response or action. There's no
guarantee that what you wrote has been incorporated into the audience's
mental conception of reality. That's what makes it asynchronous. Any
communication (i.e., building a shared mental model) that occurs is
merely incidental.</p>
<p>Even though emails and reports may not be ideal forms of
communication, there are other reasons they are useful to invest time
in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Written documents as notifications</em>: Email can be used to
document that you told someone something. Even if they don't read the
content, you can later point out that the information was provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Email as a task request</em>: Putting a task in another person's
shifts the responsibility. Emails in their queue may or may not be read,
and may or may not be acted upon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Just because you sent an email or filed a report, your responsibility to
communicate effectively hasn't finished. You need to confirm that the
audience has integrated the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Another reframing of emails and reports is to discard the concept of an
essay. When you learned to write in school, you were taught the essay
structure and associated conventions. Emails are not essays, and they
don't have to conform to the norms of essays. Three ways of novel ways
of thinking of emails are as a template, as art, and as a game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Email is Structured</strong>: Originality is not a requirement
in bureaucratic writing. Plagiarism is acceptable. The consistency of a
fill-in-the-blank template for reports is efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Email is a Piece of Art</strong>: Effort invested in each email
to improve readability means more than just careful wording. Use visual
cues (different fonts, different font sizes, highlighting, font color)
and pictures to improve readability. See Figure&nbsp;<a
href="#fig:email_computer_font" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:email_computer_font">6.5</a> for an example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Email is a Game</strong>: Email is a game of documenting
decisions and responses so that the sequence of interactions is clear
for audits and recrimination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Your emails are not constrained to an essay-like narrative
structure.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="asynchronous-communication-responsiveness">Asynchronous
Communication Responsiveness<span id="sec:email-responsiveness"
label="sec:email-responsiveness"></span></h3>
<p>Delayed response applies to any asynchronous communication such as
voicemail, email, memos, and reports. Here I'll use email, though the
same issues apply to other channels.</p>
<p>There are tiers of responsiveness, assuming the reader wants to
respond but doesn't have sufficient time available. (The explanations
below can be the other side of <span data-acronym-label="stonewalling"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">stonewalling</span> or <span
data-acronym-label="slow-rolling"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">slow-rolling</span>.)</p>
<p>Which level you are at depends on the speed of your reading, how fast
you can write, the number of incoming emails, the number of outgoing
emails, and how much time you allocate for email.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You can read all incoming emails and reply to all emails that
necessitate a response.</p></li>
<li><p>You can read all emails and reply to some.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only important emails.</p></li>
<li><p>Only emails that have short answers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You are unable to read all incoming emails.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Skim the content of all emails to find relevant information, but
likely to miss some key points.</p></li>
<li><p>Read emails from important people only (based on who the sender
is).</p></li>
<li><p>Search through your inbox if someone needs something and cites an
email that was sent to you.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You have an assistant to respond to emails.</p></li>
<li><p>You have a front office team to handle messaging.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following scenarios are focused on case 2, where you can triage
(skim) emails but do not have enough time to respond to each.</p>
<p>In a situation where you have insufficient time, which of the
following emails do you reply to? An email from your boss, an email from
your peer, an email from a person who reports to you, or a person who
you do not know? (The ratio of these email categories is not one to one
to one to one.)</p>
<p>The email from your boss is likely the top priority. Of the remaining
emails (peer, subordinate, unknown), the peer email is likely the next
priority. The subordinate and unknown person are likely last.</p>
<p>The consequence of triage is that when there's insufficient time
available, your transparency to subordinates and unknown people is
likely to decrease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Let's consider another scenario requiring triage of email. Three emails
come in. One has no action, one is easy to reply to, and the third is
difficult and takes time. Which one gets the response? As with the
previous scenario, the ratio of these inbound emails is not one to one
to one.</p>
<p>The email that is easy to reply to gets answered first. The difficult
email is second. If you only have time for one of the emails, it's
likely to be the easy one. This is an example of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_aversion">ambiguity
aversion</a> -- preferring known over the unknown. As a consequence,
outsiders see this as you demonstrating bikeshedding, also known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Law of
triviality</a>: disproportionate weight is given to trivial issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The next section quantifies the cost of email. The point of the analysis
(and similarly for meetings) is to enable comparison with other
investments the organization makes. Creating a cost model can help
determine how much effort into improving what might otherwise seem like
minor issues.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="email-is-not-free">Email is not free</h3>
<p>Bureaucracy as distributed knowledge and distributed decision-making
requires communication. Because synchronous communication like phone
calls, video calls, and in-person meetings is challenging to coordinate,
written communication is widely used for asynchronous collaboration.
Whether that written content is emails or text-based chat, writing is
expensive.</p>
<p>The cost of email includes time spent writing (authorship), time
spent reading (readership), and infrastructure costs (e.g.,
maintenance). Those three factors can be quantified as variables. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{gathered}
\text{Cost per email} =
(\text{hourly rate of writer})*(\text{time spent writing}) +\\
(\text{hourly rate of reader})*(\text{time spent reading})*(\text{number
of readers})+\\
\frac{\text{annual salary of maintainer}}{\text{number of emails per
year}} + \frac{\text{email server cost}}{\text{number of emails per
year}}
\end{gathered}\]</span> Plugging in some numbers, suppose an author
charging $50 per hour spends 5 minutes writing an email to 4 people.
Each of those four people also charges $50 per hour and spends 2 minutes
on reading. <span class="math display">\[50*(5/60) + 50*(2/60)*4 +
\frac{100000}{1000000} + \frac{10000}{1000000} = \$10.84
\label{eq:four_readers}\]</span> The cost to the organization is more
than $10 for one email! The breakdown of the three variables is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:email_pie_chart" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:email_pie_chart">6.1</a>. You've probably sent and
received more than one email in your professional career as a
bureaucrat.</p>
<p>If the cost of one email doesn't lead you to be careful with
communication, consider the cost to the organization of communication.
If email consumes 2 hours a day per person (reading and writing), and if
staffing is 50% of the organization's budget, then 12.5% of the
organization's budget is spent on email. The same math for applies to
meetings, so with 2 hours of meeting and 2 hours of email that's 25% of
the organization's personnel budget on coordination.</p>
<figure id="fig:email_pie_chart">

style="width:70.0%" />
<figcaption>Breakdown of costs for one email when the writing took 5
minutes and there were 4 readers. This example assumes an hourly rate of
$50 per person and a reading time of 2 minutes per reader. There are
three costs, but infrastructure is too small to see at 0.1% of the
costs.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="logistics-of-sending-an-email">Logistics of
Sending an Email<span id="sec:sending_email"
label="sec:sending_email"></span></h3>
<p>This section focuses on sending one email. Whether you are the only
recipient or one of many receivers can change how you interpret the
intent of the email. Whether you are in the "to" or "cc" field matters.
Unfortunately, "to" versus "cc" are not reliable indicators since email
senders do not reliably conform to the expected use.</p>
<p>An email sent to multiple recipients may have different purposes for
different readers. The reader's role or knowledge may factor into how
they interpret the content. The inclusion or exclusion of recipients
alters how the content is understood. Knowing when to switch channels
(e.g., to phone or in person) is vital.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="send-one-email-to-one-person">Send One Email
to One Person</h4>
<p>Consider the scenario where you send an email to a person. The
recipient reads the content and reacts emotionally. Alternatively, the
recipient reads the content and attempts to project what the author may
have intended.</p>
<p>In this simplest case, as the author you have to account for how the
reader might respond. Merely sending a set of facts, questions,
requests, or personal observations misses half the situation.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="an-email-to-two-people">An email to Two
People</h4>
<p>Consider a different scenario where you send an email to two people.
Now the possible responses include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recipient reads the content and responds emotionally. This is
typical.</p></li>
<li><p>Recipient reads the content and attempts to project what the
author may have intended. Especially relevant when wording is
ambiguous.</p></li>
<li><p>Recipient reads the email and attempts to project how the other
recipient might react emotionally.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That last outcome is distinct from when you sent an email to one
person. The challenge of a reader projecting how the other recipient
might react makes writing content that doesn't get misconstrued
complicated.</p>
<p>There are a couple fields in email (to, cc, bcc) to convey the
sender's intent.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"to" can serve multiple purposes: "for your situational
awareness," or "please take action," or "please respond."</p></li>
<li><p>CC is equivalent to "for your situational awareness, here's what
you told the people in the 'to' field." There's no expectation for
action by the cc'd recipients, but there is the opportunity to interject
nuance, clarification, or opposition.</p></li>
<li><p>BCC is similar to CC, but not telling other recipients (to, cc)
that the BCC'd person has awareness of the content.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Permutations available when emailing 2 people include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You could send the email to the two people both as "to"
recipients. Both recipients know the other person received the email.
You're treating them as equals. You may be expecting action or response
from each person, or this might be a notice to both people.</p></li>
<li><p>You could send the email to the two people with one person being
"to" and the other person being "cc". Typically You're not expecting a
response from the cc'd person, though they can respond as needed. The
"to" person can see that you sent the content to both people.</p></li>
<li><p>You could use BCC for one person and put the other person in the
"to" field.</p></li>
<li><p>You could BCC both recipients. Neither recipient would know who
else received the email.</p></li>
<li><p>You could send two separate emails, one to each
recipient.</p></li>
<li><p>You could send two separate emails, one to one recipient, and
then forward that email to the second recipient.</p></li>
<li><p>You can do the same as above except swapping the order of who
gets the email first and who sees that the email was sent to the
person.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the above 7 options has a different emotional connotation for
the recipients of the email. Beyond the issue that different people have
different reactions to the same content, recipients will respond
differently based on who else received the information and the order in
which the information was shared.</p>
<p>A complicating factor in the analysis of sending to two people is
whether they are peers, competitors, members of the same team with the
same role, members of the same team with different roles, if there is a
power disparity between the two recipients, or one of the manager and
the other is not.</p>
<p>A bad thing for BCC people to do is to reply to the thread and
indicate to the other recipients that they received the content.</p>
<p>A common use case for BCC is with introduction emails. You know Bob
and Sue but Bob and Sue do not know each other. You send one email with
the two of them as recipients introducing the two of them to each other.
Bob can then send a reply with Sue as a "to" recipient and you BCC'd. In
the email body, Bob will explicitly say that he has moved you to the
BCC. The consequence is that you get to see that Bob replied to Sue, but
if Sue replies to Bob by email, you don't need to be part of that
conversation.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="an-email-to-more-than-two-people">An Email to
More than Two People</h4>
<p>The new aspect that arises with 3 or more recipients is whether there
are factions among the 3 or more people. In the smallest case, options
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All three have the same reaction.</p></li>
<li><p>All three have three different reactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Two people have the same reaction, and that is different from the
third recipient's reaction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When there are groups of people (here two people form a group) then
there are insiders and outsiders. In the previous scenario when you sent
email to 2 recipients, there is no insider/outsider dichotomy (just
power imbalances). When you send email to 3 or more recipients, there
can be groups and that means having insiders (a group with a common
reaction to the email content) and outsiders (who don't have the same
reaction).</p>
<p>A recipient projecting how someone else might respond to the content
still applies, but now in addition to "How did the other person
respond?" when there were just 2 recipients the projection can also be
"How did the group respond?" or "How did the outsider respond?"</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="tactics-for-emails-with-many-recipients">Tactics for Emails with
Many Recipients</h4>
<p>The easiest escape from this complexity is to restrict the emails you
send to just one person at a time. As the sender, you no longer have to
account for how different audiences will react, nor do you have to
account for groups with different reactions.</p>
<p>When communicating with a collection of groups, splitting the message
by group can help. Partition the email into like-minded cohorts. That
way each person in their group is less concerned about how someone in
another group would respond. For example, suppose you have a message for
members of the workforce and management.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Talk with members of the workforce to understand the systemic
issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell management the issue, that it is with input of the team, and
here are solution options.</p></li>
<li><p>Forward the message you sent management to the team so they can
see that the topic was presented to management.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, team members and management getting the same message
should be two separate emails.</p>
<p>Personalized emails (using mail merge) are a way to increase the
likelihood of content consumption. This tactic is the additional benefit
the recipient doesn't know who else the message went to. Personalized
emails also remove the risk of a projected emotional reaction of a
hypothetical third party.</p>

action or response is needed, go to the next email. That may not work
for emails that have logistics associated with future events, or emails
that alter your perception of the situation.</p>

will help determine what action and response are relevant. Here I'm

By categorizing the intent of emails and reports, you can respond more
appropriately. Often the intent may be unclear, in which case a response
can be framed as curiosity-based: "I think you're seeking a decision,

id="sec:meetings" label="sec:meetings"></span></h2>
<p>Decentralized bureaucracy is characterized by distributed
decision-making and distributed knowledge supporting management of
shared resources. Bureaucrats rely on a variety of mechanisms to
communicate, one of which is a meeting with other bureaucrats.<a
href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Every participant in an organization is invested the outcome of every
decision made because there is consequence to how resources are divided
and the direction of the organization. Every bureaucrat has an opinion,
even when lacking experience or expertise.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="meeting-time-compared-to-theft">Meeting time
compared to Theft<span id="sec:financial-models-of-communication"
label="sec:financial-models-of-communication"></span></h3>
<p>In large organizations there can be significant attention given to
small purchases. A multi-step review process may be incurred for a $200
acquisition. (Typically the cost of the review process in terms of
person-hours spent isn't part of the calculus.)</p>
<p>Another measurement of value is that if an employee were to steal
even $200 worth of materials, the organization would likely punish that
employee.</p>
<p>In the book High Output Management&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1995_Grove">(Grove 1995)</span>, Grove points out that those
metrics apply to tangible goods, but not to people's time. Consider a
meeting of 10 people and each person's cost is $200 per hour. A wasted
meeting is not unusual and would not incur bureaucratic review
processes. The cost to the organization is fiscally the same -- $2000.
Similarly, consider an employee who is late and causes a loss of
productivity. Merely depriving the organization of $200 worth of time is
not punished in the same way theft is.</p>
<p>In practice, organizations default to meetings (even recurring
meetings) rather than not meet. And being late (by a few minutes) to a
meeting is commonly accepted. We can debate the differences between
theft of materials and theft of time, but these are financially
indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Being an effective bureaucrat means leveraging the distributed
knowledge present on your team and in your organization. Explaining how
to run an effective meeting (the scope of this section) is easy compared
to the work of implementing those techniques. The extra work required to
facilitate an effective meeting means the default of unproductive
discussions is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash
equilibrium</a>. In general, a Nash equilibrium is when each participant
in a scenario can improve their situation if no one else changes their
approach. We all sit in ineffective meetings because that is the easiest
thing to do.</p>
<p>Good news: you can choose to take action that disrupts the
equilibrium. The positive view of that action is that you can serve as a
role model and demonstrate behaviors of other people can learn from. The
negative view is that you are relieving the need for other people to do
work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Most bureaucratic meetings lack the formality and structure covered by
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order">Robert's
Rules of Order</a> (a set of parliamentary procedures).<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
The level of formality for meetings in bureaucratic organizations varies
widely. Most commonly bureaucrats rely on personal relationships and
social norms in meetings of less than 15 people. In that context there
are tips for effective interactions. Although many of these may seem
obvious, each of them requires extra work.</p>

<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Meeting suggestion</em>: <strong>Form relationships and
understand constituents before the meeting</strong>.<br />
To minimize surprise during meetings, socialize the concepts before the
meeting. This concept is called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemawashi">nemawashi</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>If you don't have relationships or if the topics are a surprise to
meeting participants, time will be spent educating and setting
definitions. This is an inefficient use of time when different
participants have different backgrounds and motives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Meeting suggestion</em>: <strong>Don't invite
everyone</strong>.<br />
This may seem counter-intuitive since bureaucracy is about coordination,
but having too many attendees wastes the time of people who have no
input on the issue. To identify essential attendees you need to think
ahead about which decisions are going to be made and who has the
authority to make a decision. If someone does not need to be present,
tell them in advance that you will share the meeting notes afterward.

<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Meeting suggestion</em>: <strong>Create and use an
Agenda</strong>.<br />
<em>Bad</em>: Having no meeting agenda. As a consequence, much time is
spent rehashing previous topics. No action items are recorded so
accountability is more challenging.<br />
<em>Good</em>: Have an agenda for the meeting.<br />
<em>Better</em>: <u>Share the agenda with other participants</u> before
the meeting. Having an agenda keeps attendees focused. Enables tracking
of progress during the meeting so participants are more likely to get to
all topics.<br />
<em>Best</em>: For formal meetings, <u>share the agenda in writing
before meeting</u>. Sharing the agenda in advance allows attendees to
research topics, gather data, do analysis, and form opinions. Some
attendees might be good at quick responses, others need time to think
about a topic of discussion. Opinions formed before the meeting decrease
the risk of groupthink.</p>
</div>
<p>Preparing an agenda takes time. When an agenda is created and shared,
attendees might not take the time to read the agenda before the
meeting.</p>
<p>Attendees may not stick to the agenda during the meeting. Enforcing
agenda discipline requires someone willing to combat the natural entropy
of human interactions.</p>

<p>As a bureaucrat you may not see taking care of details like this as
your responsibility. Ensuring well-run logistics and effective use of
infrastructure may not be your area of expertise, you lack training in
this domain, it's not in your job description, and you won't get
promoted for taking care of it.</p>
<p>Attention to detail outside the scope of your official duties helps

with what deadlines.</p>
</div>
<p>There is a spectrum of options for meeting notes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No one takes notes. The arguments used to defend this approach
include, "I'm too busy participating in the discussion," "I'm not able
to write summaries during the interaction," and "Taking notes isn't my
responsibility." In practice the memory of each attendee is not as good
as the attendee might think.</p></li>
<li><p>One person takes notes for everyone. The person in the role of

participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Each person takes notes; no sharing and no aggregation.</p></li>
<li><p>Each person takes notes; with aggregation and sharing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Changing the cultural norms for a team or organization can come from

<div class="samepage">
<p><em>Meeting suggestion</em>: <strong>Facilitator's ground
rules</strong>.<br />
To run a smooth and productive meeting, I explicitly state two ground
rules to the attendees:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>If you want to talk, raise your hand and I will call on you. If
multiple people want to talk, I'll track the order of speakers.</p></li>
<li><p>If you talk too long, I'll cut you off.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach is critical when there are many people present, when
people with diverse backgrounds are present, or when there is a mixture
of dominant and submissive personalities present. If a visual signal
like hand raising is not used, reliance on verbal interruption defaults
to dominant personalities. Waiting for a person to finish speaking
doesn't work for everyone because some participants will use more than
their fair share of time. Speaking for a long time needs to be addressed
regardless of whether an intentional effort to exclude others or a
consequence of verbosity.</p>
<p>As a facilitator, my focus is on structure (distinct phases of the
discussion) and ensuring participation. I remove myself from taking part
in the discussion.</p>
<p>The facilitator does not need to share all their guardrails with
participants. You should have a structure in mind before starting the
meeting. For example,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Establish understanding of what the topic is. Without a shared
focus and a common goal a meeting is unlikely to be productive.</p></li>
<li><p>Set aside topics that are not the focus. Either discuss outside
the current meeting or defer to a later meeting. Managing scope is
critical to accomplishing the goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a shared language specific to the topic and the
participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish each participant's viewpoint on the topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Brainstorm options.</p></li>
<li><p>Build consensus or nominate a decider.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Meeting suggestion</em>: <strong>Facilitate Asking Dumb Questions
without Feeling Intimidated</strong>.<br />
Asking a question of an expert from a position of ignorance can feel
intimidating. You may worry you're wasting the expert's time. In a
recurring meeting a facilitator can address this by having participants
write questions on paper and submit them anonymously. The questions or
discussion topics can then be raised at following meetings.</p>
</div>
<p>To facilitate anonymity every participant must be given paper and
pen, and every participant must write something on the paper. The
facilitator then has to collect the paper from each participant. For
contributors who don't have a question, they can write down feedback
about the meeting.</p>
<p>This technique allows the expert to get the information needed for a
response, or to figure out who the best person to respond is.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="characterizing-meetings">Characterizing
Meetings<span id="sec:characterizing-meetings"
label="sec:characterizing-meetings"></span></h3>
<p>Characterizing meetings is critical to distinguishing which norms are
applicable, and what people expect from the different formats.</p>
<p>Meetings can be categorized as internal meetings, customer meetings,
conferences, <a href="#sec:meetings-one-on-one">scheduled
one-on-ones</a>, or <a href="#sec:walk-arounds">impromptu
walk-arounds</a>. These are easy to label and participants agree on the
labels. A more important framing is to evaluate the potential purposes
of a meeting. The relevance of this approach is that sometimes
participants in a meeting wouldn't agree about the purpose (if that
question is raised) and sometimes the purpose of a meeting evolves
during the meeting.</p>
<p>Standard reasons bureaucrats have to create a meeting include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To gather input from attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>To make a pronouncement to attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>To educate attendees. Formally labeled as a training course, but
often makes an appearance in meetings that weren't initially intended to
be educational.</p></li>
<li><p>To educate one person. Especially important if the person lacking
context is the decision-maker.</p></li>
<li><p>To signal interaction. Participants in these meetings can say
they met with other stakeholders, but that doesn't imply value was
generated.</p></li>
<li><p>To brainstorm ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>To make progress towards a goal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the purpose is not explicitly stated, confusion arises. When
multiple purposes occur in one meeting and the transition is not
explicitly stated, confusion arises. The reason for this confusion is
that the assumptions and expectations and norms of each purpose are
different. When the attendees don't know the purpose or the purpose
shifts, the expected behaviors and roles are unclear.</p>
<p>An attendee can ask what the purpose of the meeting is during the
meeting but that is generally considered rude. An attendee can try to
deduce the purpose of a meeting, but this takes time and attention and
can result in the wrong conclusion. An attendee can try to set the
purpose of the meeting during the meeting, but this can conflict with
the intent of other attendees.</p>
<p>A meeting's purpose can shift during a meeting. If done
intentionally, the changes should be stated explicitly. Otherwise an
attendee may continue to work under the previous set of expectations
rather than the current norms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Level of formality, start time (early or on time or late), end time
(early or on time or late), utility, duration, number of attendees,
number of speakers, and number of participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Meetings involve people, either known or strangers. Meetings involve
information, either relevant or irrelevant. Relevant information is
either new or related to previous work. Meetings either have a leader or
no leader (e.g., team brainstorming). If there's a leader, the leader
may be disseminating information to participants or gathering
information from attendees.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="walk-around-impromptu-meetings">Walk-around
impromptu meetings<span id="sec:walk-arounds"
label="sec:walk-arounds"></span></h3>
<p>Meetings aren't constrained to occur in conference rooms around a
table with everyone seated. Walking around the shared office space and
having conversations with coworkers can be an intentional form of
informal meeting. This is a way to break the problem described by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve">Allen curve</a> -- that
communication drops as spatial separation increases.</p>
<p>Ambushing coworkers when they aren't expecting interruption takes
tact. As the (potential) interrupter, you need to be sensitive that
other people may not want to be interrupted, while others seek diversion
from their current task. If you're the person being interrupted by the
coworker walking around, you have the right to deferral.</p>
<p>Walking around and finding people to talk with can be for <a
href="#sec:socializing">social engagement</a> or to discuss tasks you
are working on. In either case, you are interrupting existing
activities. Presence creates priority, whether intentional or
accidental.</p>
<p>This concept isn't new. In the American Revolution, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_von_Steuben">Baron
von Steuben</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George

members of their army.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="one-on-one-check-in-meetings">One-on-one
check-in meetings<span id="sec:meetings-one-on-one"
label="sec:meetings-one-on-one"></span></h3>
<p>In contrast to the ambush of a walk-around, formal one-on-one
meetings are typically a planned interaction between a supervisor and a
team member. These discussions can be mutually beneficial. The meeting
is an opportunity for the supervisor to coach the team member and for
the supervisor to learn what the problems are on the team. From the team
member's perspective, a one-on-one is an opportunity to ensure alignment
with the team's direction and provide insight into how to improve the
team. There can be education in both directions.</p>
<p>When a supervisor oversees multiple team members, holding one-on-ones
can take a lot of time. With ten team members and an hour every other
week, that's 12.5% of the supervisor's time without counting prep and
documenting the discussion outcomes. There's a risk that the mindset
becomes "no news is good news" or "everything is going well, no need to
engage." The consequence of that minimal mode is that only <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagull_management">negative
feedback causes interaction</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
A constructive check-in requires forethought for both the supervisor and
the team members. For one-on-one meetings there are generic questions
that can help the supervisor understand the team member's status.</p>
<p>A supervisor should ask the team member questions <a href="#fn34"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What have you been successful with since we last met?</p></li>
<li><p>What is blocking our team's progress?</p></li>
<li><p>What are your plans?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you collaborating with the rest of the team?</p></li>
<li><p>If you could change one thing about our organization, what would
it be and why?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you plan to train your coworkers on topics you understand
and they don't?</p></li>
<li><p>What have you learned in the past month?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the biggest risks for the team?</p></li>
<li><p>What's limiting your productivity?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Responding to these questions takes time (an hour) and a willingness
to be open.</p>
<p>If the supervisor doesn't ask these questions, the team member can
include them in the agenda and bring them up.</p>
<p>Preparation for the one-on-one is a shared responsibility. The
supervisor can review notes from the previous discussion and any
artifacts that have been in progress. Before the meeting, the team
member should document responses to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What was discussed previously?</p></li>
<li><p>What progress has been made since the previous meeting?</p></li>
<li><p>What is blocking progress?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The generic questions above may not fit all situations, like when a
new bureaucrat joins an existing team. The one-on-one check-in should be
tailored to the phase of the employee's progression. Frequency of
check-ins depends on the newness of the team member, the complexity of
the work, or how quickly the conditions are changing.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Welcome to the team!</u><br />
<em>Scenario: New team member, either new to the team or new to the
organization.</em><br />
Here the focus of the one-on-one is to ensure a smooth onboarding
process. Get them up-to-speed on the technical challenges, professional
norms, and integrated with other team members. Resolve administrative
blockers like the following: Does the employee have the necessary
computer log-in accounts? Do they have an email account? Are they on the
mailing list?<br />
<em>Questions you can ask</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the goals for the team?</p></li>
<li><p>What items on the onboarding checklist are not yet

The purpose of this one-on-one is to help the team member define their
success. Activities include planning, resource allocation, and
assessment. This phase is characterized by the need to coordinate with
others on the team or other teams. Team member understands task scope
and intent and relevant processes. Team member decomposes task into
subtasks.<br />
<em>Questions you can ask</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How do the artifacts you're working on support your plan for the
team's progress?</p></li>
<li><p>What dependencies does that deliverable have (external to the
team or internal to the team)?</p></li>
<li><p>What insights do you have about the team or
organization?</p></li>
<li><p>What insights do you have about the relevance of the task
relative to the purpose of the organization?</p></li>
<li><p>What should management be doing to enable the team's
success?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The duration of this phase could be the rest of a
career.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Facilitator</u><br />
<em>Scenario: Facilitating the productivity of others.</em><br />
Rather than being task-oriented, this team member supports
coworkers.<br />
<em>Questions you can ask</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What observations from mentoring team members do you
have?</p></li>
<li><p>What collaborations should we be fostering?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Name of phase</em>: <u>Peer</u><br />
<em>Scenario: Peer check-in.</em><br />
This one-on-one is a form of mentorship. The value of the exchange is to
get a different perspective and to hold each other accountable.</p></li>

Bad Presentations<span id="sec:bad-presentations"

<p>Occasionally you attend a meeting with a bad presentation. The slides
may appear slick but the content is poorly thought out. Or the presenter
does not understand the topic well. Or the presenter has good content
but does not convey it well. Or the presenter is wrong about the topic.
Regardless of the cause, you should assume the presenter is making their
best effort.</p>
<p>You could remain silent, complain, criticize, ask leading questions,
or offer constructive feedback. Your silence may result in other
attendees and the presenter leaving with incomplete or wrong
information. If you speak up you'll prolong the meeting or limit the
presenter's time to convey their material.</p>
<p>Your assessment of the presentation may be wrong. You may lack
relevant information. A reliable technique for interjection is to assume
a state of confusion instead of confidently asserting that the presenter
is wrong. If you believe the presenter is wrong, asking about the source
of their information is a good entry point.</p>
<p>You should ask for clarification when the information is correct but
presented poorly (or above the level you understand).</p>

<p>In addition to the questions above, another way to think ahead is the
sequential tasks associated with the presentation. The following can
serve as a checklist.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="planning-your-presentation">Planning your
presentation</h4>
<p>Evaluate your audience's experience and education before creating the
presentation. The question you are addressing in your presentation may
be independent of the audience, but the level of delivery depends on the
audience's background.</p>
<p>When speaking to an audience outside your field, aim to use jargon
your audience is familiar with. Another tactic is to look for areas of
commonality and then build on that.</p>
<p>When introducing your topic, there are a few ways to open the
talk:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Compliment</strong> the audience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Humor</strong>: tell a relevant joke.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: Tell how this work makes you
feel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers</strong>: Explain context and relevance in terms
of money, number of people involved, and size of the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare the content:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tell a coherent story with a unified theme. Each slide should be
logically connected to the following slide. Don't just put a bunch of
slides with data or pictures together. You risk disorienting your
audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Run spell check before presenting.</p></li>
<li><p>Translate your slides from your native language to the language
of your audience.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the visual content in presentations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Switching between dark and light slides in a dark room stresses
the eyes. The audience needs time to adjust to varying light
levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Images should use both color contrast and distinct symbols; this
is called redundant coding.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick colors that are accessible for colorblind audiences. For
example green and magenta are better than green and red.</p></li>
<li><p>Making slides appear "professional" means adding
non-informational content. This added content should be consistent, not
distracting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Common choices include LaTeX(specifically <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)">Beamer</a>),
Microsoft <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint">PowerPoint</a>,
and Apple's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation_software)">Keynote</a>.
You are sending a few messages to your audience if you use Microsoft
Word, a document PDF, Notepad, or any other non-presentation software to
make a presentation. The two messages are first, the audience isn't
worth the time you needed to develop a proper presentation, and second,
you are not technically savvy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Live demos can invigorate a boring presentation. Besides the
interactivity aspect, the audience is excited by the risk of technical
failure. If you plan to give a live demo, have screenshots of the
process in the presentation. That way, if the demo fails you can show
what was supposed to happen in the slides. If the demo works, skip the
slides.</p>
<p>Practice the presentation (out loud in real-time) at least once. Use
the setup as close to reality as possible for practice sessions. Project
onto the screen using the projector. This experiment will show if the
color contrast is sufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Questions to ask your host:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Will I have a projector and screen for the presentation?</p></li>
<li><p>For the technology I'm using (PowerPoint, PDF, Keynote), which
version is provided? Or does the speaker bring their computer? Or is
there internet access?</p></li>
<li><p>How to best get the presentation content to the host? Bring a USB
drive or laptop, or email the presentation file to the host?</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="day-of-talk">Day of talk</h4>
<p>Appearance (suit and tie or jeans and t-shirt?):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Underdressed = I don't respect the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Overdressed = I'm better than you.</p></li>
<li><p>Similar level of dress = I'm a peer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Some of these suggestions should seem glaringly obvious. They are here
because I have seen them in "official" presentations given by a
"professional." For example, do not curse. No profanity while speaking,
in the slide presentation, or even the name of the file.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="before-the-talk-begins">Before the talk
begins</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure your facility has power, a screen, a projector, a pointer,
and any other necessary equipment. (Don't rely on your host to think of
these things for you.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all equipment works and functions together.</p></li>
<li><p>Before the presentation begins, use a slide to make announcements
and reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>List the agenda if there are multiple speakers.</p></li>
<li><p>Time talk begins, how long it will last.</p></li>
<li><p>Reminder: Turn OFF Cell Phones. Airplane mode is insufficient
since previously set alarms can ring.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Announce whether to ask questions during the talk (i.e., the
audience should interrupt) or to hold questions until done.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="during-the-talk">During the talk</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Opening: Thank hosts, inviters, and organizers. Establish a
connection between you (the speaker) and the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not pace.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not stand frozen.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are the only person laughing at your joke, it isn't
funny.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="end-of-your-presentation">End of Your
Presentation</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Let the person asking the question finish. Even if you think you
know what they are going to ask, wait.</p></li>
<li><p>Restate the question to make sure the audience heard it and that
you understood it.</p></li>
<li><p>Aim for shorter responses. Save your longer answer for a
follow-up discussion after the audience has been released.</p></li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>Because bureaucratic policies and processes seem convoluted, let's
start from a more relatable point: your personal habits. You might eat
at the same time every day, or you might go to bed at the same time most
nights. Those are both examples of personal policies. Sticking to a
routine decreases the need to think about options. In the same way,
bureaucrats in organizations seek routines to decrease uncertainty.</p>
<p>You have experience with creating and using personal policies (your
habits). Bureaucratic processes for organizations are similar. Both are
routines that ease the burden of decision-making. A habit can be
intentional (e.g., my policy is to brush my teeth before going to bed),
just as a process can be designed. Habits can be unconscious (e.g.,
arriving at work without recalling driving there), just as processes can
arise without an intentional design.</p>
<p>Consider your intentional habits -- they are likely motivated by a
personal policy. Similarly, bureaucrats acting on behalf of an
organization apply processes that support the policies of the
organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
This chapter covers the <a href="#sec:definition-of-process">what</a> ,
<a href="#sec:why-processes-exist">why</a> , and <a
href="#sec:process-chaos">how</a> of processes. The last sections of
this chapter (<a href="#sec:design-of-processes">design</a> and <a
href="#sec:change-a-process">change</a> ) assume a level of control and
autonomy that you may not think you have. Regardless of where your role
is in the hierarchy, your purpose is to provide value to the
organization. That value can be negotiated with fellow bureaucrats on
improvements to the design of task workflows.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.1" id="why-do-processes-exist"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Why do Processes Exist?<span
id="sec:why-processes-exist"
label="sec:why-processes-exist"></span></h2>
<p>The following sections explain why organizations rely on processes.
The reasoning matters to you in your role as a bureaucrat when you
design a process or try to revise an existing process. Similarly, as a
person going through a process, the reasoning below explains why you are
experiencing <span data-acronym-label="process friction"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process friction</span>.</p>
<p>Processes are used by bureaucrats to leverage specialization, improve
throughput, and enable consistent application of policies.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-enable-consistent-application-of-policy">Processes Enable
Consistent Application of Policy</h3>
<p>While social processes may work well for low-volume ad-hoc requests,
formalized bureaucratic processes become necessary for recurring
high-volume activities.</p>
<div class="mdframed">
<p>When a medical emergency occurs for a patient who is already in the
hospital, a team of medical staff is called to respond. Every medical
team member has the knowledge associated with their role. One approach
could be to have the team members negotiate the best approach before
engaging the patient. To save time for routine actions a process is
developed that eliminates the need for negotiating.</p>
<p>There is limited time available to respond to a patient emergency by
a medical team. To decrease the latency for medical treatment roles are
designated before the emergency during training sessions. Where each
team member stands with respect to the patient is worked out ahead of
time so that even if you don't know the nurse's name, you know the
person is a nurse based on where they are standing at the bedside. The
lead doctor stands at the foot of the bed to ensure they have a clear
line of sight to the patient and team members.</p>
<p>Training for routine medical events allows emergencies to be handled
with less cognitive load for the staff, resulting in fewer mistakes and
less time to resolution.</p>
</div>
<p>Organizations are an abstraction intended to be insensitive to
individual participants. That de-personalization applies to both
bureaucrats and subjects. (In practice, outcomes depend on who the
bureaucrat is and who the subject is.)</p>
<p>Consistent application of policies through the use of process
decreases risk of mismanaging the shared resource. At the same time, the
risk to the bureaucrats carrying out the process is also decreased. The
use of processes addresses the risk of both immediate bad behavior and
the potential of things going bad in the future. Process is the
guardrail limiting harm to bureaucrats and the shared resource.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of
the commons</a>, is a motive for bureaucracy. The tragedy of the commons
refers to the concept that when there is a shared resource, someone in
the community will try to get away with behavior that is harmful to the
community of users. Limiting harmful behavior can take the form of
oversight processes. If oversight processes are not in place, malicious
can actors dominate.</p>
<p>Another example guardrail is keeping stakeholders informed
(justifications) so that intervention can be taken if needed.</p>
<p>Each process for oversight, review, or approval may be justifiable
when evaluated in isolation, but the aggregate can feel unreasonably
burdensome to both subjects and bureaucrats.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="processes-enable-simplification">Processes
Enable Simplification</h3>
<p>Compared to an ad hoc approach, processes are intended to simplify
what could otherwise be complicated moral decisions or complex
coordination challenges. Simplification by using a process is intended
to benefit the bureaucrats involved and the subject of bureaucracy. The
benefits can be challenging to comprehend for stakeholders actively
engaged in a process.</p>
<p>The relation between the complexity of a task and the skills of the
bureaucratic workforce is another motive for the creation of processes.
A positive story is that specialization allows narrow focus and thus
deeper understanding and skill. An alternative perspective is that
specialization allows for dumbing down the role, thus enabling a cheaper
workforce. See Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:complexity-and-size"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:complexity-and-size">7.1</a> &nbsp; for a visualization
of the trade-off.</p>
<figure id="fig:complexity-and-size">
<img src="images/people-per-task-for-skill-level.png"
style="width:90.0%" />
<figcaption>A task that one smart person can do might take two people
who are not as smart. This concept applies to any task size and any
population of workers. In this diagram three levels of task complexity
are shown. As task complexity increases, the size of the team needs to
grow with intelligence held constant. The growth may be less if the team
members are brilliant. Those brilliant people cost more and there are
fewer of them available.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Applying a process allows dumb individuals to accomplish complicated
things. The collective talent exceeds that of any individual. As a
specific example, consider the process of designing and building a car.
That complexity is feasible to undertake for a skilled and knowledgeable
individual, but the cheaper approach is to hire individuals capable of
installing the passenger-side doors in an assembly line. The same
reasoning applies to the next reason processes are used -- to improve
throughput.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-enable-increased-throughput">Processes Enable Increased
Throughput</h3>
<p>Processes that leverage specialization can improve scalability. Adam
Smith's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process%23Adam_Smith">example
of a pin factory</a> cites a productivity gain of 240 times better than
the artisanal approach. Similarly, the introduction of moving assembly
lines in Ford's car factory produced cars 8 times faster throughput.<a
href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Using processes improves throughput
both through simplification described in the previous section and
because increasing the number of participants in the process is
easier.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-enable-less-reliance-on-social-relations">Processes Enable
Less Reliance on Social Relations</h3>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations comprised of humans feature informal
relations among bureaucrats. If there were no processes the policies
could still be inflicted through social influence. Processes used by
bureaucrats formalize how policies get enacted.</p>
<p>There is an interplay between personal relationships and bureaucratic
processes; you should not rely exclusively on either approach. The
relation between bureaucratic processes and social bonds was noted by
Selznick in his 1943 paper&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="1943_Selznick">(Selznick 1943)</span>. Social influence is
not antithetical to processes. There's always a mixture of the two.</p>
<p>Attempting to generalize claims about professional bonds in an
organization is beyond the scope of this book. For a given complexity
and given scale, some people are more sociable and less sociable and
therefore desire more or less process. Some bureaucrats want documented
processes and are confused as to how things are operating when formal
processes aren't present.</p>
<p>The invisibility of informal professional relationships limits
bureaucrats not attuned to the importance of these informal bonds.
Informal professional influence among bureaucrats lacks transparency.
Informal professional relationships can be hard to uncover and are not
documented. Bureaucrats who do not take the initiative to form and
maintain professional relationships or social relationships want
processes so that they can be told what to do. Processes are also a way
to avoid an interpersonal (professional) conflict which most people fear
and avoid. The ability to professionally disagree is a skill worth
learning.</p>
<p>In contrast to informal professional relationships, processes are
easier to understand and track. The counter to informal influence is the
hierarchical <span data-acronym-label="org chart"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">org chart</span>. Relying on
top-down directives for formal processes enables bureaucrats to avoid
responsibility.</p>
<p>Not all members of an organization have social relationships to
leverage. The next section describes the benefits of having a process
for participants who lack relationships.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="processes-enable-new-bureaucrats-and-subjects">Processes Enable New
Bureaucrats and Subjects</h3>
<p>Bureaucrats new to a team are likely to ask, "What are the processes
and where is the documentation?" Bureaucrats who have been on a team for
a long time say, "Don't burden me with processes; I just need to get
things done using the relationships I have with people." One motive for
processes is to help with onboarding team members who don't yet have
relationships.</p>
<p>Besides not having formed a social network, there's a second reason
new people seek processes. New team members who recently graduated from
school are used to the existence of formal processes at the high school
or university level. Therefore when they join a job, they expect a
similar set of conditions for processes to exist and follow.</p>
<p>Once this motive for processes is recognized, the relevance when
onboarding new hires is clear. New hires will need to discover the
existing processes while they form social bonds. Discovering processes
comes through oral folklore or written documentation. One technique to
augment both discovery of processes and the creation of relationships is
to have new hires sit with experienced team members. This is described
in the section on <a href="#sec:prisoner-exchange">Prisoner exchange</a>
. Where you sit matters to your effectiveness as a bureaucrat because
locality matters for creating relationships.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="processes-enable-promotion">Processes Enable
Promotion</h3>
<p>Processes can arise organically (bottom-up) or be created top-down.
In either context, creating a new process counts as bureaucratic
innovation. Misguided managers of bureaucrats consider process creation
worthy of promotion because the managers fail to distinguish novelty
from innovation. Real innovation incurs risk, whereas new processes are
merely novel. Both cause change, but processes are typically designed to
decrease risk. Rewarding decreased risk is reasonable, but it shouldn't
be labeled as innovation.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.2" id="riding-the-chaos"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Riding the Chaos<span
id="sec:process-chaos" label="sec:process-chaos"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations are imperfect because they are composed of
humans. A bureaucratic organization is a complex and chaotic
environment.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> A sensible response is to impose
processes, hierarchy, and roles. Imposing structure can feel
intellectually fulfilling and emotionally satisfying. Imposing structure
looks like progress and may even help with your promotion in the
hierarchy. The challenge (or continual source of employment) is that
chaos is dynamic. A process created in response to chaos creates new
challenges and is disrupted by changes in the number of staff, changes
to who is part of the process, and changes to the amount of work. The
half-life of structure depends on the rate of change of tasking and the
rate of <a href="#sec:turnover">personnel turnover</a>.</p>
<p>A bureaucrat facing perpetual chaos could strive for perfection, run
away from the chaos (to something less chaotic), exploit the chaos, or
adopt an attitude of "I do what I can" or "I'll wait out the chaos."
Another option, and the focus of this section, is to build skills for
navigating the chaos of a bureaucratic organization.</p>
<p>You can build and maintain your network of professional connections
with fellow bureaucrats. This augments the chain of command of a
hierarchy. There is a turnover in both hierarchical roles and in your
professional network, so you need to continually invest effort in
creating new bonds and maintaining existing relations.</p>
<p>You can see change as an opportunity for improvement rather than a
destruction of your previous investments. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">sunk cost fallacy</a>
applies both to your emotional state and the resources you invested.
Fear of change is prudent -- change disrupts the comfort of stability and
known processes. Anticipating change and preparing for it eases the
stress of change.</p>
<p>You can leverage personalities and unique traits rather than
expecting everyone to be interchangeable and treating differences as
flaws. By knowing the strengths, interests, and weaknesses of coworkers,
you can facilitate the process of change.</p>

<p>Bureaucratic processes require working with other people. One source
of friction is that participants may lack familiarity with the
process.</p>
<p>This observation can be quantified with a small number of
assumptions. When there are more inexperienced people than experienced
people, the distribution of team membership tenure might fit a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law
distribution</a>. What matters in this context is how long the team
member has been in their role rather than how long they've been a member
of the organization. Assume a max tenure of ten years&nbsp;<span
class="citation" data-cites="2022_BLS_tenure">(Labor Statistics
2022)</span>. With these conditions, if the process involves five people
then the least experienced member will have a median of 100 calendar
days of experience.</p>

<p>Three calendar months (or 70 business days) may be inadequate for
complex processes or processes that are infrequent (quarterly or
annual), especially if there was no training. When the number of
participants is ten people, then the median tenure of the youngest
participant is 51 calendar days (37 business days).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p>To recap, the assumptions made were:</p>

<li><p>Random, independent sampling of organization members.</p></li>

id="sec:automating-processes"
label="sec:automating-processes"></span></h2>
<p>The desire to automate processes is widespread. Automation has the
benefits of consistency, predictability, decreased labor costs, and
easier troubleshooting. When physical objects are involved, then
robotics is necessary for automation. For bureaucratic organizations
that deal with intangibles (referred to as "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker">knowledge
work</a>"), automation often involves computers.</p>
<p>While the benefits of automation are typically clear to participants,
there are barriers to automation you will need to address. As with
making information discoverable and searchable, automation requires an
investment of time, money, and skills that are ancillary to the purpose
of the organization. A transition from manual processes to automated
workflows requires doing the original work while enabling automation.
Creating the conditions that are needed for automation has a delayed
pay-off.</p>
<p>The evolution of automating a process involves</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Identify who is involved in the process. How did the process get
created and how has it evolved up to now? Who evaluates the success of
the process?</p></li>
<li><p>For existing processes, transition verbal folklore to written
documentation. The purpose of this step is to write down the workflow,
business logic, and relevant decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>Transition the documentation in the previous step from plain text
documentation to structured data. Examples of structured text that can
be parsed by a computer include decision trees and workflow diagrams.
Implementation could be in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz">Graphviz</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint">PowerPoint</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect metrics (for example, the number of times the software
application was opened, how frequently the folder was reviewed, how much
time was spent on the webpage) for existing manual processes to enable
cost evaluation for implementing automation. This is the modern version
of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_motion_study">time
and motion study</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Implement stand-alone software (scripts) for each task using
personal automation tools like <a
href="https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyAutoGUI</a> (a free
Python-based automation package) or <a
href="https://www.autoitscript.com/site/">AutoIt</a> (a free
domain-specific language for Windows GUI applications).</p></li>
<li><p>Tie the scripts in the previous step to the task workflows from
step 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Create an automation assistant that actively monitors your
activities (keystrokes, mouse clicks, on-screen events) to detect
repetitive actions that are candidates for automation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The path described above is not accessible to many bureaucrats for
multiple reasons. The barriers to automating bureaucracy depend on
having relevant skills, IT resources, and predictable workflows that
justify the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment">return on
investment</a>. Compounding these hurdles, the skill of identifying
opportunities for automation depends on your practical skills (what are
you capable of) and your experience.</p>
<p>Where you are in the hierarchy of your bureaucratic organization
affects your options. Automating bureaucracy from the bottom-up can be
augmented and supported by management. At the organizational level,
there are system-level changes like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hire people who desire automation and the skills to enact

<p>Automation can reduce labor costs, but designing, implementing,
maintaining, and updating automation requires significant investment, a
change of culture, and new skills for the workforce.</p>
<p>When automating bureaucratic processes, exceptions disrupt the
expected workflow of tasks that comprise the process. Handling
exceptions is a tricky subjective topic because exceptions are sometimes
critical to allow for and can be abused. Abuse of exceptions to a
process can originate from the subjects of a process or from the
bureaucrats administering the process.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.5" id="exceptions-to-a-process"><span
class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Exceptions to a Process<span
id="sec:exceptions-to-process"
label="sec:exceptions-to-process"></span></h2>
<p>Process designers are usually motivated to address a specific issue
associated with access to shared resources. When bureaucrats execute a
process to support a policy, there may be cases that violate the
designer's assumptions. Now the person with the exceptional case and the
bureaucrat carrying out the policy has extra work to deal with the
broken process. This is a source of <a
href="#sec:bureaucratic-debt">bureaucratic debt</a>.</p>
<p>When the routine process is inadequate, there are routes for
exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Change the process to address the exceptional case. This takes
extra time and work for the subject and the bureaucrat.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore the process. Use relationships instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore the task. If the result isn't crucial to your efforts and
the work is too burdensome compared to alternatives, stop the
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Seek an exception to the process. The exception can be recurring
or one-time. The justification for the exception can be based on the
social capital of participants (title, reputation) or be a data-driven
argument or some mixture of both.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The designer of a process may not be able to anticipate future
circumstances, but expecting the capacity to be responsive to change is
reasonable. The process designer should use sunset provisions and escape
hatches. A sunset provision can be time-based (e.g., this policy expires
after three years) or based on a threshold (e.g., this policy should be
evaluated for renewal after 1000 cases). An escape hatch specifies the
conditions under which the participants are excepted from the policy. A
good escape hatch for a policy provides directions about what follow-on
actions should be taken.</p>
<p>Another reason processes may be inadequate is due to urgency. A
result that is needed quickly may not fit the timeline of sequential
tasks for a process.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="time-sensitivity-exceptions">Time Sensitivity
Exceptions</h3>
<p>Exceptions to a process may be required when a result is needed
quickly. In the medical setting, there are categories of urgency; a task
may be routine, priority, urgent, or stat. Each of those categories is
associated with a time-bound, though the specific duration varies by
medical domain and by location&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2022_priority_definitions 2018_order_priority">(unknown
2022, 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>Common failure modes for processes include abuse of prioritization
(everything is important) or abuse of urgency (everything is needed
quickly). Either of these abuses need to be corrected to have a healthy
bureaucracy, but typically the cost of labeling an effort as "priority"
or "urgent" is low.</p>
<p>Interaction between the bureaucrats tasked with work and the people
characterizing relative value is needed to limit the abuse of processes.
This interaction is a negotiation of what work gets done when and in
what order. Labeling every task as "urgent" is a failure to communicate
the relative value of a set of tasks.</p>
<p>Process friction can arise from the separation of roles needed to
support a process. Those separate roles can happen within a team of
bureaucrats, or the process can span distinct teams. The difficulty
imposed across teams within an organization is moderated by the
existence of a common arbiter in the chain of command. Troubleshooting
processes is even more complicated when processes span
organizations.</p>

<p>When two independently-managed processes interact across

especially between two organizations that lack shared coordination,
results in either <a href="#sec:exceptions-to-process">exceptions to the

<p>The following stories illustrate process friction between teams
within an organization and process friction between organizations. The
teams within an organization have shared objectives set by the
organization, whereas separate organizations lack incentives to

<p>Two teams operating within an organization, with a shared intent and
working relationship, may be stuck with the process they have even when
the friction is clear. When organizations lack a common objective,
friction can be even more significant.</p>

<div class="mdframed">
<p>I have dental insurance. I visited the dentist on December 2. One of
the procedures during a routine cleaning was "bitewing x-rays." This
procedure is covered by my insurance, so I was surprised when I received
a bill for it from my dentist a few weeks after my visit.</p>
<p>I called my dentist and they explained that the dental insurance had
declined to pay for the procedure. I called the insurance company on
January 3 and they confirmed that the procedure was covered by my
policy. Every time I called the insurance provider I had to provide my
social security number, date of birth, and zip code twice -- once to the
automated system, a second time to the person I talk with. The insurance
company had made a mistake and said they would cover the cost of the
procedure. I followed up with my dentist and explained the
situation.</p>
<p>I called the dentist to see if they had received payment yet. They
had not, so I called the dental insurance provider again on February 6
and 8. On February 8 the insurance company said they would process the
payment within 7-10 business days. I called again on February 20 and the
claim hadn't been started within the insurance company. I spoke to the
supervisor and she said she would personally visit the claims office
within the insurance company.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the dentist, they are seeking money for the
service they provided me.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the insurance company, delaying payment on a
claim makes good financial sense -- the policyholder is likely to just
pay the balance to avoid going to court with the dentist.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the question is whether chasing this issue makes
financial sense. I think of my hourly rate as $40, so after an hour the
charge of $38 would have been better to pay out of pocket. Effectively
I'm devaluing my time. The emotional stress and thought-cycles spent are
also relevant, though harder to quantify.</p>
<p>Streamlining bureaucratic processes does not occur automatically.
There needs to be both incentive to change and authority to make the
change.</p>
</div>
<p>In the above story, the dental office wanted to be paid for services
provided. The insurance company wanted to minimize the number of
payments made. And I wanted to minimize my costs. While none of those
are conflicting, each organization has separate objectives.</p>

id="deploying-bureaucrats-to-different-teams-or-organizations">Deploying
Bureaucrats to Different Teams or Organizations<span
id="sec:prisoner-exchange" label="sec:prisoner-exchange"></span></h3>
<p>One method of addressing friction between teams or organizations is
to deploy a person across boundaries. This may not result in a specific
change, but it can help members of both the originating team and the
receiving team better understand their counterparts. For the rest of
this section I'll use "Team&nbsp;A" as the origin and "Team&nbsp;B" as the
receiver, though the concept applies to an exchange of organization
members. The name of the bureaucrat in this example is Mark. This
example covers an informal deployment in which Mark remains employed
with Team&nbsp;A. While Mark is with Team&nbsp;B he provides the management of
Team&nbsp;A with a weekly activity report.</p>
<p>The easiest question regarding Mark's deployment to Team&nbsp;B is "How
long?" That depends on the purpose of the exercise and the complexity of
the work Mark will be doing with Team&nbsp;B, as well as how long Team&nbsp;A can
operate without Mark's contributions. What is a successful outcome for
Mark? For Team&nbsp;A? For Team&nbsp;B? For the organization? How long will the
integration of Mark onto Team&nbsp;B take? Does Mark need time on Team&nbsp;A to
delegate his current work?</p>
<p>A deployment harms the productivity of originating Team&nbsp;A by loss of
staff. The deployment also harms Mark's productivity for his work with
Team&nbsp;A. The deployment harms the receiving Team&nbsp;B since they have to
train or integrate Mark.</p>
<p>Incentives for this investment include cross-training for Mark,
better process empathy for both teams, and temporary (exceptional)
support. What is Team&nbsp;B expecting from Mark? How will Team&nbsp;A benefit?
What is Mark expecting to gain from the deployment? Or is this a
sacrifice on Mark's part?</p>
<p>Cross-training Mark can improve Mark's productivity and the teams.
Team&nbsp;B gets to hear an outsider's perspective from Mark, and Mark
returns to Team&nbsp;A with a broader perspective of the organization. A
deployment can build relationships among the teams. Both teams are
better able to address process friction or exceptional interactions.</p>
<p>Potential engagement modes for Mark: consultant (providing knowledge
to Team&nbsp;B), integree (increasing the capacity of Team&nbsp;B), or shadowing
(learning from Team&nbsp;B). Shadowing can be of an individual on Team&nbsp;B, or
Mark can shadow Team&nbsp;B by attending meetings.</p>
<p>Mark could be deployed full-time for the entire duration, split his
time between teams, or build up and then decrease over the course of the
deployment. Are there criteria for early termination of the deployment?
Are there criteria for extending Mark's deployment?</p>
<p>There are a few considerations for your team. Are you on the
originating team A or the receiving team B? Who gets deployed? How is
Mark picked? Was the opportunity advertised? If you're receiving Mark,
what are your acceptance criteria? How many concurrent deployments can
your team support?</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="service-level-agreements">Service-level
Agreements<span id="sec:sla" label="sec:sla"></span></h3>
<p>When two teams or two organizations need to interact repeatedly, a
formalized approach is to create a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">service-level
agreement</a>. While a service-level agreement (SLA) is constructive for
outlining what each party expects from the other, within a bureaucracy
an SLA is typically not a legally binding contractual agreement. Instead
of a judge resolving disputes, an SLA within a bureaucracy may be
adjudicated by a supervisor common to the two teams.</p>
<p>A service-level agreement within a bureaucracy is dependent on the
goodwill and honor of the signatories. Since an SLA is a formalization
of a relationship, it is subject to revision when there is turnover of
signatories in the teams.</p>
<p>A service-level agreement should include providing historical and
live data to stakeholders so violations can be measured. Measurements
are needed because enforcement of the SLA is by the signatories.
Observability is key to accountability.</p>
<p>A supervisor common to the parties may be invoked when an SLA is not
met or if there is a dispute over the interpretation of an SLA. Usually
the threat of invoking oversight is enough to coerce a change in
negotiations. When the common supervisor gets involved, there are not
many options available for sanctions. The supervisor could withhold
bonuses or promotions, assign a new team lead, or re-negotiate the
SLA.</p>
<p>Because creation of SLAs is burdensome to all parties involved,
monitoring to enable enforcement incurs work, and punishment is limited,
most cooperation between teams and between organizations is informal and
ad hoc. Relying on personal relationships is easier than formal
agreements. Reputations, both for individual bureaucrats and for teams
and organizations, are then formed based on performance and
reliability.</p>

<p>Any process involving humans incurs mistakes.<a href="#fn39"

The only way to drive the number of mistakes to zero is by doing
nothing, but that isn't a practical way of managing shared resources.
The purpose of pondering bureaucratic mistakes is to come up with ways
to limit the consequence of mistakes to cause damage while not
inhibiting progress.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="fixes-are-difficult">Fixes are Difficult</h3>
<p>Imposing checks on a process as a way to reduce mistakes creates more
bureaucracy. The extra work can be in the form of redundant data
collection or by requiring more justification.</p>
<p>Maintaining coordination of diverse activities in a bureaucracy
requires that information propagate up the chain of command to a common
authority. Some mistakes like duplication of effort can only be detected
by checks made high up the chain of command. A less formal mechanism is
to leverage informal relations between bureaucrats that operate outside
the hierarchical chain of command.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="fixes-fail">Fixes Fail</h3>
<p>The path of information from the person with a problem to the person
who can address the situation may pass through many people. At each
hand-off there is a significant chance the information is
unintentionally mangled.</p>
<p>The consequence is familiar to people who have played the <a

<div class="mdframed">

</div>
<p>This is a solvable problem: the engineer could talk with the

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="where-process-mistakes-come-from">Where
Process Mistakes come from</h3>
<p>Mistakes in a process can originate from the bureaucrat who inflicts
the process, in the hand-off between participants, or from the <span

data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span> of the bureaucratic
process. Typically there are more checks on subjects and fewer on
bureaucrats.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="choices-about-mistakes">Choices about
Mistakes</h3>
<p>As a process participant, you may cause a mistake or observe a
mistake. Your options are to either ignore it, fix it (which incurs
extra work), or report it. If you choose to report it, you can do so
anonymously (which decreases the risk of harm to your reputation but
also eliminates feedback) or with your name so that discussion can occur
and you get feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Brainstorming types of mistakes and causes of mistakes for processes is
important not just for developing Process Empathy. Understanding
mistakes is helpful if you want to revise a process or create a new
process.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.8" id="design-of-processes"><span
class="header-section-number">7.8</span> Design of Processes<span
id="sec:design-of-processes"
label="sec:design-of-processes"></span></h2>
<p>The most effective process is a minimal process. When designing a
process, look for ways to minimize the work for the people involved.
Minimizing work (both physical and mental) for the people involved means
less sensitivity to entropy in a bureaucracy. Minimizing work requires
significant situational awareness on the part of the designer. To
minimize the requirements to achieve success, minimizing the effect on
existing bureaucracy is vital.</p>
<p>Another question to ask when designing a bureaucratic process is
whether a process is needed. Can the goal be accomplished by relying on
ad hoc responses and leveraging relationships among bureaucrats? There
is a Goldilocks situation for the number of processes in an
organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Too few processes (all social relationships). New participants,
lacking necessary relationships, find the team or organization
chaotic.</p></li>
<li><p>Just the right amount -- a balance of process and social
relationships, and knowing when to use which. Each participant has a
different view about what the right balance is based on what
relationships are accessible to them, and how burdensome they find a
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Too much process (not enough leveraging of social relationships).
When this happens, bureaucrats can end up resorting to the use of social
relationships to circumvent burdensome processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This optimization is like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer curve</a> in
economics: there's a sweet-spot between the extremes.</p>
<p>Because bureaucrats are typically not formally trained in designing
processes, ad hoc ideas reactive to the immediate situation and local
constraints are used. A thoughtful process designer tries to account for
exceptions</p>
<p>and potential mistakes.</p>
<p>Minimal processes and subtle change may not be available. The
following sections describe why static process designs are the norm, the
role of bureaucratic debt, and how to design for turnover of staff.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="static-and-dynamic-processes">Static and
Dynamic Processes<span id="sec:static-dynamic-processes"
label="sec:static-dynamic-processes"></span></h3>
<p>Change within an <span data-acronym-label="organization"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">organization</span> is to be expected
since the external environment the organization exists in is not static.
Sources of external change include improving technology, changes to the
<span data-acronym-label="shared resource"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">shared resource</span>, or shifting
expectations of subjects of the bureaucracy. Change is also driven
internally to the organization by <a href="#sec:turnover">turnover of
staff</a>. Since change is expected, why are static processes that are
not robust to change created in the first place? Because static
processes are easier to design and appear initially to require less
maintenance.</p>
<p>Creating robust processes that are dynamic takes more effort to
create. First, the process must be documented so that it can be
analyzed. What is expected to happen? Who are the stakeholders? These
conditions are likely to change, making the process fragile. Second,
document assumptions used in the process. If the assumptions are
invalidated, then the process is broken and needs to be discarded or at
least revised.</p>
<p>A challenge is that even when the process is documented and
assumptions enumerated, there may not be an incentive to check to see if
revision is necessary. Measurements (which are costly and disruptive)
need to be periodically taken to see if the assumptions are still
applicable. To force periodic validation of assumptions, one approach is
to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision">sunset
provisions</a> -- automatic expiration dates set at the time of
creation.</p>
<p>A more quantitative approach (and even less frequently used) is to
tie a process to a cost-benefit model. Enacting a process provides a
benefit and comes at some cost. If the assumptions of the process can be
tied to a cost-benefit model, then we can determine whether the process
is worth enacting. Periodic measurements are needed to update the
cost-benefit model and determine whether the process is effective.</p>
<p>Summarizing the steps for creating a robust process,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>List assumptions. Who are the stakeholders, what are the goals,
and what are the constraints?</p></li>
<li><p>Relate the assumptions to a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">cost-benefit
model</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the measurable parameters of the cost-benefit
model.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect recurring measurements to verify the
assumptions.</p></li>
<li><p>If the assumptions are broken, revise the process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A robust process is just a fragile process with a feedback loop
informed by ongoing measurements. Robust processes require extra work by
bureaucrats compared to static processes. A static process shifts the
burden to subjects. In this situation bureaucrats have externalized the
burden. In practice, ignoring exceptions and reacting to problems is
common because then there's less work for the bureaucrats enacting the
process. Process Empathy in this case is not just rationalizing
suboptimal behavior, but empowers you to take action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The above description of robust dynamic processes and fragile static
processes characterizes workflows in isolation from the history of a
team or organization. Typically processes are evolved from previous
processes. That evolution induces another source of bureaucratic
friction.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="decisions-and-processes-create-bureaucratic-debt">Decisions and
Processes Create Bureaucratic Debt<span id="sec:bureaucratic-debt"
label="sec:bureaucratic-debt"></span></h3>
<p>Suppose a <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> is enacted and later
found to be ineffective. Some work is needed to revise the process and
hopefully improve effectiveness (or an <a
href="#sec:exceptions-to-process">exception</a> is needed). Bureaucratic
debt<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> is the work needed to change a
process. Bureaucratic debt is caused by choosing an easy solution now
(with limited information or insufficient resources) instead of using an
approach that would take longer to design and enact but be more
robust.</p>
<p>Decisions made by bureaucrats occur in a resource-constrained
environment. Getting information (measurement) and analysis are costly
in terms of money, time, skill, and labor. Each decision made results in
options that are not explored. These missed opportunities are associated
with short-term versus long-term trade-offs of costs.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity
costs</a> (options the organization doesn't take) alter which future
decisions become available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The purpose of defining bureaucratic debt as a concept is to capture the
work resulting from decisions that would otherwise be unaccounted for.
Once the concept of bureaucratic debt is understood it can be
tracked.</p>
<p>To document bureaucratic debt, you need to record aspects of
decisions as they are made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the decision to be made?</p></li>
<li><p>When was the decision identified?</p></li>
<li><p>When was the decision made?</p></li>
<li><p>Who made the decision?</p></li>
<li><p>What options were identified?</p></li>
<li><p>Which option was chosen?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was that option chosen over the other options?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of documenting decisions is to enable both aversion to
bad decisions and attraction to good decisions. That may sound strange,
but the default of decision-makers is to apply the same behavior in
future decisions. Without documenting decisions, there is no
transparency, accountability, historical measure of progress, or ability
to track dependencies.</p>
<p>Creating a record of decisions is necessary but not sufficient. The
documentation of decisions needs to be shared with stakeholders to
enable accountability. This should occur as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>Every bureaucrat exercises policies that apply to subjects, even if
the subjects are other bureaucrats. What I'm describing above is beyond
merely documenting what the processes and policies are for subjects.
Documenting bureaucratic debt is for use internal to the team or
organization.</p>
<p>The scale of decision impact determines the level of documentation.
"Do I choose pencil or pen?" incurs negligible bureaucratic debt;
therefore the documentation needed is also negligible. Projecting the
consequence of decisions is a subjective prediction.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="design-processes-for-turnover-of-staff">Design Processes for
Turnover of Staff<span id="sec:turnover"
label="sec:turnover"></span></h3>
<p>When designing a <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span>, there are a few goals
to optimize for: time-to-first-result, average latency, initial
financial cost, total financial cost, flexibility to input conditions,
throughput, and scalability. In theory all these factors should inform
decision-making. An often neglected aspect that is harder to predict and
harder to measure is the importance of employee turnover. On a long time
scale, the turnover of bureaucrats is a significant source of risk for
any team or project.</p>
<p>Besides the loss of knowledge associated with turnover, another
complication is the change of assumptions when new people join an
existing process. Processes are enacted differently than initially
intended because the people implementing them are not the same people
who came up with and designed them. One solution (rarely enacted) is to
document the assumptions and reasoning for the design of a process.
Having a written record enables bureaucrats who were not present at the
time of conception to understand the purpose of the process.</p>
<p>The conditions under which a process is created are not static --
requirements and resources change. Making processes resilient to change
requires bureaucrats to be educated beyond the requirements of the
immediate task. The relevance of education is on-going: during
onboarding of the bureaucrat, while carrying out the process, and as
bureaucrats exit participation in the process.</p>
<p>Providing training for a process is complicated by the variety of
bureaucrats participating in a process. That is why designing a process
typically relies on roles -- participants are treated as interchangeable
with other people who have similar skills. As a bureaucrat coming up
with a novel process, accounting for differences in enthusiasm or
communication among participants is difficult. Designing processes that
are robust to turnover does not mean ignoring the unique talents of
participants. To account for differences emphasize documentation that
explains the how and why in training new participants.</p>
<p>Onboarding new bureaucrats involves technical training, explanation
of norms, learning the processes, and creating a professional network of
coworkers. During this onboarding the new bureaucrat should be
documenting their observations. Postponing the creation of documentation
until the new person has experience results in a skewed and incomplete
capture of the challenges.</p>
<p>Trained and experienced bureaucrats executing a process are
responsible for coordinating with other bureaucrats. Bureaucrats should
be cross-trained in other roles to gain familiarity with other parts of
a process.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats exiting the team or organization or changing roles have a
responsibility to document their knowledge for team members. An exit
interview can inform how the team improves.</p>
<p>In each phase, documentation is the mechanism for spreading
knowledge. Documenting the why (in addition to the how) is critical for
the reader. How frequently documentation is accessed should be measured
to determine whether there was value in investing in documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The opportunity for you to create novel processes is likely to be rare
if you are a bureaucrat in an old organization or team. A more frequent
activity is updating and revising existing processes. The next section
covers topics specific to changing a process.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.9" id="change-existing-processes"><span
class="header-section-number">7.9</span> Change Existing Processes<span
id="sec:change-a-process" label="sec:change-a-process"></span></h2>
<p>New processes can arise organically or be issued as top-down edicts.
Processes evolve to fit the constraints of available resources and
skills of bureaucrats and subjects. These causes of consistent flux mean
updates to policies and processes are ongoing. Whether you are a
bureaucrat administering a process, a subject burdened by a process, or
a bureaucrat responsible for revising processes, you have input on
changes.</p>
<p>Processes change over time because the conditions change. When a
bureaucratic process is no longer providing value to the organization or
the participants, change is needed.</p>
<p>Changing complex processes is hard because individuals involved in
the process may depend on steps that are not visible to other
people.</p>
<p>Making change more complicated is the entanglement of interdependent
processes. Processes do not exist in isolation. A version of Hyrum's
Law&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2017_Hyrum">(Hyrum, n.d.)</span>
modified for a bureaucratic context is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With a sufficient number of stakeholders of a process, it does not
matter what you describe as the steps; all aspects of your process will
be depended on by somebody."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a change to processes is attempted, change is slow to happen
because of lag in feedback loops.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="bureaucratic-inertia">Bureaucratic

<p>Creating an organization, recruiting staff, getting funding, getting
office space, setting up communication technologies, and creating
processes is a significant investment of time, money, and people. That
same work applies when making changes to the size and scope of an
organization (making it larger or smaller). Because this work and
attention take time, there is a lag associated with changes to an
organization that better reflect the scope of tasks and the number of
tasks. The lag of changes as they ripple through an organization

inertia</a>.</p>
<p>On a more personal scale, the causes of bureaucratic inertia are
attributable to changes to processes or creating new processes. A
process displaces the need for bureaucrats to think, so new processes
force bureaucrats to think about their roles or develop new skills.</p>
<p>Another source of bureaucratic inertia is the over-subscription of
tasks to the amount of attention available and resources available. In
the situation where there aren't enough resources or attention, then the
response to some tasks is necessarily delayed or left unaddressed.
Delayed tasks block the workflows that depend on those outcomes.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="why-change-a-process">Why Change a
Process</h3>
<p>Why changes to a process occur in a bureaucratic organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To improve an existing process that is working as desired (i.e.,
a more clever or efficient solution).</p></li>
<li><p>Improving an existing process by undoing mistakes previously
made.</p></li>
<li><p>Inventing a new process where there previously was not
one.</p></li>
<li><p>If utility and improvement are difficult to quantify bureaucratic
activities, then bureaucrats may be promoted based on change instead of
whether value was delivered.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you recognize that processes are evolutionary, then the right
response is to allow and look for iterative change (fail fast) rather
than trying to create static processes.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="how-to-change-a-process">How to Change a
Process</h3>
<p>Change to a process can come from the top of the organization's
hierarchy or from the bottom.</p>
<p>When change is driven from the top-down,<br />
<em>Benefit</em>: Unified vision enables global optimization.<br />
<em>Inefficiency</em>: Can't see all the details from the top, so
solutions may not fit well.<br />
<em>Resolution</em>: Better reporting up the chain.</p>
<p>When change is driven from the bottom up,<br />
<em>Benefit</em>: Each component in the hierarchy has local control,
sees local aspects, and creates solutions for the local problem.<br />
<em>Inefficiency</em>: Local optimization<a href="#fn41"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>
across multiple components in a workflow can yield suboptimal
outcomes.<br />
<em>Resolution</em>: Each local component acts with the same
objective.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you are in the hierarchy, there are generally
applicable tips for changing a process. The first is to segment the
stakeholders, the second is to find critical <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop">OODA loops</a>, and the
third is to alter how you notify stakeholders.</p>
<p>Even if you use the tactics described here, you are likely to
encounter resistance. Transitioning from legacy processes to new
processes impacts the bureaucrats involved. Changes have to overcome
legacy investments. People can feel threatened by the change of role or
skills.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="tactic-segment-stakeholders">Tactic: Segment
Stakeholders</h3>
<p>The people a process is inflicted upon are not all the same. Some
example categories of bureaucratic subjects are normal users, power
users, and malicious users. In a similar manner, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation">segmenting</a>
the stakeholders for a potential change can help you distinguish
different levels of support or resistance.</p>
<p>The concept of a <span data-acronym-label="stakeholder"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">stakeholder</span> is broader than
just the people in various roles carrying out the tasks associated with
a bureaucratic process. To be more effective in enacting change,
identify people in the following groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People interested in active collaboration. They may not share
your zeal, but finding shared activities is helpful for
participation.</p></li>
<li><p>People who passively support the activity but do not provide
resources. May provide feedback or enlarge the coalition.</p></li>
<li><p>People who don't care and are not engaged.</p></li>
<li><p>People who disagree with you. Seek these contrarians out to
refine the idea or scope. Negotiate! Be open to evolving the concept to
address or at least acknowledge their concerns.</p></li>
<li><p>People who are actively working against you. Try to understand
their motives. Not through speculation, but by direct discussion.
Written communication is inadequate; face-to-face is best since you are
more likely to be treated like a human rather than an idea or
concept.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Which segment a person is part of changes as your scope and timeline
shifts. Their activities and priorities may cause their position to
evolve.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="tactic-find-critical-ooda-loops">Tactic: Find
Critical OODA loops</h3>
<p>Influence is not distributed equitably among members of a team or
organization. For that reason, surveys may be misleading. If you want to
change a process, focusing your attention on crucial influencers is more
effective than trying to spend the same amount of time learning from
every bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The colloquial use of "influencer" doesn't reflect the bureaucratic
sense of shaping the direction of an organization or team. Because the
term "leader" is over-used, a more precise label is "maven." Some mavens
are highly visible, while other mavens work behind the scenes. Mavens
may or may not be highly placed in the hierarchy of the organization,
and they may not have fancy titles.</p>
<p>The approach to changing a process being described here takes two
steps: figure out who matters in an organization or team, then change
how those influencers think and act.</p>
<p>The first step is to use a social implementation of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> to find the
relevant mavens for a given topic or process. You start your search with
random bureaucrats (sampled from across the organization). In a
one-on-one interaction, ask the person who they would recommend talking
to. "Who else would you recommend talking to about this topic?" is the
last question in the first conversation. To start this search process,
start with your first-order social connections. Cover both low-level
bureaucrats and those higher in the chain of command.</p>
<p>Once you've started your search for mavens, leverage the trust
already in the social network by starting conversations with "When I
spoke with Bob he recommended I talk to you about <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>name of topic<span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>."</p>
<p>Once you've identified mavens for the topic or process you want to
change, the next step is to change how the mavens think.</p>
<p>A model for human decision-making is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop">OODA loop</a>. If you
want to change a process, change the people; if you want to change
people, change their OODA loop. That means changing the data the person
is aware of (what they observe), changing the external incentives (how
they orient), and teaching them new decision frameworks (e.g.,
cost-benefit models).</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="tactic-approval-forgiveness-opposition">Tactic: Approval,
Forgiveness, Opposition<span id="sec:approval-forgiveness-opposition"
label="sec:approval-forgiveness-opposition"></span></h3>
<p>Bureaucracy involves decision-making. A common task for bureaucrats
is seeking consensus regarding action or spending resources. There are
distinct options for how to get that consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seek approval before taking action. This approach incurs both
providing justification and waiting.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask forgiveness after taking action. Often viewed as being in
contrast to seeking approval. Less delay, and usually works if things go
well or if no one notices.</p></li>
<li><p>Notification of Intent with a deadline for response. The window
for a response should be sufficient to allow feedback. If no response is
provided default is for action to be taken.</p></li>
<li><p>Solicit opposition before taking action&nbsp;<span class="citation"
data-cites="2009_Perr">(Perr 2009)</span>. This is a different framing
from approval or forgiveness. It decreases the risk the approver has to
take on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to proceed depends on the personalities of the people
involved in building consensus and their relationships.</p>
<p>Most organizations default to approval-based processes. Each new idea
needs to be signed off as approved by a sequential list of bureaucrats.
The sequential (not concurrent) process may be known in advance, or it
may be ad hoc if the request is novel.</p>
<p>Relying on approval is harmful to innovation because sign-off by each
bureaucrat is interpreted as "I am 100% in agreement with this." Each
stakeholder has to bless innovation and tie their reputation to the
outcome.</p>
<p>Flip your phrasing from "Do I have your approval to..." to "Are you
opposed to..." Soliciting opposition is a more useful paradigm because
the default response is "I won't stop this." With framing of seeking
opposition then the bureaucrat reviewing the idea can avoid taking
responsibility for the idea and therefore is not tying their reputation
to the result.</p>

You could operate within a <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> and entirely focus
on just doing the job you were hired for and ignore administrative
distractions. Or you can be more effective in your job by understanding
the role of engaging with other people -- peer bureaucrats, supervisors,
and subjects of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Learning bureaucracy as a skill doesn't mean you can ignore the
personalities of individuals. The skill of navigating bureaucracy is
separate from and in addition to being a good person, being an effective
member of a team, being a good project manager, being a good product
owner, skillful writing, excellent verbal communication skills, applying
technical skills, etc. The distinction from those aspects is that as a
bureaucrat you understand the complications and constraints of your
environment and then can more effectively operate within those
conditions.</p>
<p>If you are new to being a <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span>, then this book
armed you with an understanding of your environment. On your first day
of employment you are capable of framing new information constructively.
If you are an experienced bureaucrat, it is not too late to improve.
Even on your last day of employment you can learn and be more
effective.</p>
<p>In this book I described bureaucracy and provided options for action.
Concepts for improving your effectiveness like learning the history of
your situation, and identifying and engaging stakeholders to learn their
perspective were explained. Other techniques include brainstorming the
incentives of the individuals involved, and listing what levers they
have for action. What are the <a
href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a>? Are there feedback loops? If
you can apply these generalized perspectives to your specific situation,
you are applying the paradigm developed throughout this book.</p>
<p>The narrow scope of your role (which hopefully leverages your
education or training) does not capture all relevant aspects of your
job. Based on the definition of <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span>, the critical
aspects of success include having knowledge, sharing your knowledge,
leveraging the knowledge of others, effective communication, working
well with other people, understanding the role of both processes and
social influence, and the interplay of those aspects.</p>
<p>The attitude of the effective bureaucrat is that of realistic
optimism. A realistic optimist will occasionally be wrong but make
progress, whereas a pessimist will be right (because the prediction is
self-fulfilling) but not make progress.</p>

Summary of This Book</h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is pervasive because it is crucial for society.
Bureaucracy is defined by decisions originating from the management of
access to shared resources. The resources can be either tangible or in
the form of expertise. When there are multiple bureaucrats participating
in an organization, <span data-acronym-label="decentralized bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">decentralized bureaucracy</span>
relies on distributed knowledge and distributed decision-making.</p>
<p>There are common artifacts that stem from the coordination necessary
for bureaucracy: hierarchy (which enables specialization and decision
authority) and communication -- verbal and written, whether for informal
or formal meetings. Weak feedback loops are a crucial feature for
understanding motives for decision-making in bureaucracy. A policy
defines what to do in a certain context -- how to make a decision. A
process is the steps of enacting the policy.</p>
<p>Policies are typically intended to help all participants, both
bureaucrats and subjects. The value of processes is that they are
predictable. There's less cognitive load for bureaucrats and less
emotional burden because "I'm just following the rules." For subjects
the value of a process is that requirements are clear and can be deemed
fair in application. There's no need to form relationships with the
people administering the shared resources.</p>
<p>The negative effect of a process can occur in both exceptional
contexts and cases where relationships already exist. Then policies and
processes get in the way.</p>
<p>Having both relationship-based and policy-based paradigms in effect
at the same time is disruptive to each paradigm. This inability of the
two approaches (ad hoc versus systematic) to coexist is one reason why
bureaucracy is consistently in turmoil. Therefore an effective
bureaucrat learns to take advantage of the dynamics. Being a skilled
bureaucrat involves forming and maintaining relationships with fellow
bureaucrats and subjects, comprehending and leveraging existing policies
and processes, and disrupting existing processes with innovative
policies.</p>
<p>Process empathy is helpful in your role as a bureaucrat and when you
are subject to bureaucracy. Process empathy is based on your
understanding the <a href="#sec:dilemma-trilemma">dilemmas</a> and <a
href="#sec:unavoidable-hazards">unavoidable hazards</a> of bureaucracy,
recognizing internal motives and external incentives that individuals in
each role have, and your ability to reconstruct the sequence of
decisions that led to the current situation.</p>
<p>Innovation is stifled by bureaucracy because individual bureaucrats
have incentive to adhere to existing policies and processes as a way to
decrease their risk. Innovation requires adapting policies to new
contexts and discarding irrelevant policies. The <a
href="#sec:extending-Heilmeier">extended Heilmeier questions</a> can be
used to interrogate the relevance of policies in a specific context.</p>
<p>Not all challenges you encounter as a bureaucrat in an organization
are attributable to bureaucracy. The distribution of tasks in an
organization lacking hierarchy can induce latency when not everyone has
all relevant skills for tasks. Specialization of skills can improve task
throughput when processes are stable, but specialization can hinder task
throughput when task complexity requires coordination.</p>
<h1 data-number="10" id="interview-questions"><span

<p>The following two sections are a set of questions for interviews
involving bureaucrats. The first section is for the hiring manager and
the <a href="#sec:moving-to-new-team">second section</a> is for the
candidate.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="interviewing-a-candidate">Interviewing a
Candidate</h2>
<p>Interviewing candidates for a bureaucratic position should involve
the evaluation of skills specific to bureaucracy. For example, ask
questions that lead the candidate to discuss their experience
facilitating coordination, working with experts from other domains,
learning from self-reflection, having an ability to professionally
disagree, and practicing negotiation.</p>
<p>A specific phrasing I use below is "Tell me about a time you..."
rather than asking the candidate to speculate about a hypothetical
scenario ("What would you do if..."). The retrospective story is more
concrete and shows the candidate's ability to reflect on their
behaviors.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tell me about a time you had competing priorities.<br />
<em>What to evaluate for</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did the interviewee coordinate a response with other people?
Teamwork is an essential skill in a bureaucratic organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Did the interviewee clarify a misconception?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How does this position fit into your career goal?<br />
<em>What to evaluate for</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can the organization provide the candidate what they are
seeking?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In previous jobs, how often did you check in with your supervisor
(formally or informally)?<br />
<em>What to evaluate for</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does the candidate communicate with their supervisor?</p></li>
<li><p>Who starts the discussion?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In previous jobs, how often did you check in with your coworkers
(formally or informally)?<br />
<em>What to evaluate for</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does the candidate communicate with their peers?</p></li>
<li><p>Who starts the discussion?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In previous jobs, in what situations did you turn to your boss
for help? Or did your boss help you?<br />
<em>What to evaluate for</em>:</p>

ill-defined scope) for a task.</p></li>
<li><p>In previous jobs, how did you evaluate the success and
shortcomings of your organization?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the leading indicators you look for that the team you

ill-defined, or constantly shifting.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe how you responded to a mistake you made at
work.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell me about a time the organization you were in changed and how
you navigated that.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell me about a time when you, in your role as an expert,
collaborated with people who didn't share your expertise. How does that
compare with interacting with fellow experts?</p></li>
<li><p>When you have learned a new topic in the past, what strategies
did you use to balance understanding the theory and doing the
practice?</p></li>
<li><p>How have you assessed your progress when you were learning a new

Team<span id="sec:moving-to-new-team"

<p>Before leaving the team you're on, reflect on your current role:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are my current care-abouts?</p></li>
<li><p>What would I miss from my current role? Are there projects,
tasks, responsibilities, or people that I will miss? If yes, can I
change my current role to have more of what I like?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can negotiate with your management and coworkers to address your
needs. Sometimes other people are not aware of what you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Once you are interviewing for a position, you should consider the
interactions as a chance to learn more about the work and the people.
When interviewing for a new position, ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the team growing or is the focus shifting?<br />
(Teams hire to replace or grow. If replacing, why did the person leave?
If growing, is it an increase in capacity, an expansion of scope, or a
change of focus?)</p></li>
<li><p>What's the turnover rate of the team I would be joining? Has
anyone quit? Has anyone recently joined?</p></li>
<li><p>How many members are there on the team I would be joining?<br />
(Is the team size stable, or does it fluctuate according to changes in
tasking?)</p></li>
<li><p>Would I be on a single team, or would my work span multiple
teams?</p></li>
<li><p>How many different roles would a person in my position
have?</p></li>

<li><p>How many meetings would I have per day? Per week?</p></li>
<li><p>What indicates success in my new team?</p></li>
<li><p>What indicates failure in my new team?</p></li>

<li><p>How is my team evaluated?</p></li>
<li><p>Who do I report to?</p></li>
<li><p>How many bosses do I have?</p></li>
<li><p>What balance of independence and collaboration is expected of
me?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I identify what to work on or is a task assigned to me? If a
task is assigned, who assigns the work? (the customer or a manager or
another team?)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the typical duration of a task I would work on?<br />
(An hour or a day or a week or a month or a year.)</p></li>
<li><p>How does my new team support my autonomy?</p></li>
<li><p>What support does the organization provide a person in my role?

class="header-section-number">11</span> Coordination of Tasks Causes
Slowdown<span id="sec:work-distribution"
label="sec:work-distribution"></span></h1>
<p>Decentralized bureaucracy is part of the explanation for patterns
observed when people coordinate. A separate explanatory factor is how
tasks get distributed among members of an organization. These two
aspects of participating in an organization are often confounded. This
appendix describes a model of processes and tasks that involve only
coordination. The purpose of the model in this appendix is to
distinguish aspects of an organization that are not due to
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>This model shows that task coordination can cause the difference
between being busy and being productive when coordination is activity.
Another conclusion from the model is that the reward for being a capable
contributor is more tasks.</p>
<p>The model of task distribution in an organization is sufficiently
detailed to illustrate commonly observed situations but is agnostic to
the specific tasks or work roles. Improvements to the model intended to
increase the realism could be made, but risk decreasing the clarity of
the model.</p>
<h2 data-number="11.1"
id="assumptions-in-the-model-of-task-distribution"><span
class="header-section-number">11.1</span> Assumptions in the Model of
Task Distribution</h2>
<p>The model relies on a few concepts. These definitions are local to
the model and do not apply to the rest of the book:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Specialization</strong> refers to categories of ability.
A person has a specialization. Completing a task requires a
specialization. Practical examples of specialization include lifting
boxes from the ground onto a shelf, writing a report summarizing an
experiment, providing customer support, or creating a contract for a
service. In the model specializations are abstracted to distinct
categories.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skill-level</strong> is a ranking of proficiency for how
a task is done. If a task requires a skill-level higher than a person
has, then that person is unable to complete the task. Practical examples
of skill-levels include the ability to lift small boxes versus large
boxes, a poorly written report versus a well-written report, mediocre
customer support versus amazing customer support, and an acceptable
contract versus a robust contract. In the model skill-levels are
abstracted as non-negative ordinal values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Person</strong>: a member of the organization, has
specializations, has a skill-level per specialization, can receive
tasks, and can engage with other people in the organization. In this
model a person can complete one task at a time. A person can coordinate
one task at a time. A person has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Person's <strong>backlog</strong>: Each person maintains a queue
of tasks to be done.</p></li>
<li><p>Person's <strong>status</strong>: A person is either idle (not
assigned a task), working on a task, or coordinating with other
people.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Organization</strong>: a set of people who can be
assigned tasks to work on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Task</strong>: requires one specialization, has an
associated minimum skill-level, and has an amount of time that the task
takes. A task can only be worked on by one person at a time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process</strong>: comprised of one or more tasks.<a
href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Tasks in a process are worked on
sequentially by people. At any given time the process is owned by one
person who is either coordinating or working on the task. Processes are
independent from other processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coordination</strong> is the effort to find a person with
the relevant specialization and skill-level for a task.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the model the label task is used instead of work. In Physics the
concept of work applies when there is a product that is tangible and
countable. Making tacos takes work; whereas approving requests is a
distinct concept because there is nothing tangible. For knowledge
workers, which most bureaucrats are, the unit of tasking is more
applicable. Instead of tangible work, tasks are relevant when <span
data-acronym-label="attention-time"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">attention-time</span> is spent on an
issue. Each participant in the organization has the same amount of
attention-time to spend, but different specializations and skill-levels
per specialization.</p>
<p>When a person is assigned a task they don't have the specialization
for or lack enough skill-level in that specialization, then they have to
find someone else in the organization who is capable of doing the task.
The task is given to the first available randomly selected sufficiently
qualified person, regardless of the size of their backlog. This is
consistent with organizations for which each person's task backlog is
not visible to coworkers. As a consequence, tasks are added to their
backlog and they will get to the task eventually.</p>
<p>The model relies on a process being a sequence of tasks. That might
not be realistic when branching is part of a process. Real processes
feature two kinds of branching. The first kind of branching is
conditional logic: "if this then something else that." The second kind
of branching is when a task is the initiation point of multiple other
processes. Regardless of which kind of branching is applicable in a
situation, from the perspective of individual people involved a process
can be treated as an independent sequence of tasks.</p>
<p>The following simplifying assumptions are used in the model. The list
of what isn't in the numerical model of tasks includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is nothing in the model about policies,
decision-making&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="2009_Klimek">(Klimek,
Hanel, and Thurner 2009)</span>, shared resources, or subjects of
bureaucracy. This model is included in a book about bureaucracy to show
that not all patterns observed in an organization should be blamed on
bureaucracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Specializations are discrete. The justification is that there are
tasks that one person see as infeasible and someone else sees as
straightforward.</p></li>
<li><p>Skill-levels are discrete. The justification is that there are
tasks that are inaccessible to some skill-levels. For example, 10 high
school students are unlikely to be able to complete a task that one PhD
physicist can do.</p></li>
<li><p>There's no hierarchy in the model. The model assumes people are
cooperating in the organization. Unlike the rest of the book, this model
does not use the distinction of organizations being comprised of
teams.</p></li>
<li><p>People in the model don't get to initiate tasks of their own
volition. They work on tasks that are either from their personal backlog
or from an infinite set of tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>People in the model don't get to refuse any task that is assigned
to them for which they have the specialization and relevant
skill-level.</p></li>
<li><p>No overtime. Every person gets the same amount of time to do
work.</p></li>
<li><p>No support staff. No delegation to less skilled people.</p></li>
<li><p>No prioritization of tasks in the backlog. Tasks in the backlog
are completed in the order in which they were added.</p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure needed for communication works without failure.
Infrastructure needed for completion of a task works without
failure.</p></li>
<li><p>No dark patterns. Everyone does the task assigned promptly and
correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>No turnover of staff during the simulation. See section&nbsp;<a
href="#sec:new-person" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:new-person">[sec:new-person]</a> for an accounting
of new people in a process.</p></li>
<li><p>No improvement of skill-level per person and no expansion of
specializations. No training or learning happens.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The complexities above are not included in the model because the
point of the model is to show what arises from simple constraints.</p>
<p>Within the constraints, improvements could be made to the model.
However, conclusions drawn from the model map to real-world
organizations even without these features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use realistic distributions (e.g., power law) instead of uniform
distributions for parameters like skill-level, specialization, and task
duration.</p></li>
<li><p>When a person is not qualified to do a task, instead of searching
randomly, search second-order contacts. The current (unrealistic)
implementation is that a person sends their request for help to random
members of the organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Adding nuance for realism would increase the complexity of the model
but is not expected to alter the conclusions.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="tasks-and-processes">Tasks and Processes</h3>
<p>A task that requires skill-level 2 in specialization B is labeled
"B2." The assumption that a task requires one specialization is based on
the idea that a process can be broken into a sequence of atomic tasks,
and that one person can do an atomic task.</p>
<p>A process is a sequence of tasks. For example, the list "B2:10, A1:5,
C3:7" describes three tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Task requiring specialization B and skill-level 2; duration of 10
minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Task requiring specialization A and skill-level 1; duration of 5
minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Task requiring specialization C and skill-level 3; duration of 7
minutes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In this model tasks can be done by more skilled people faster. If a
task requires skill-level 2 and takes 10 minutes, then</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A person with skill-level 2 completes the task in 10
minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>A person with skill-level 3 completes the task in 7 minutes
(=10/(3/2)).</p></li>
<li><p>A person with skill-level 1 is unable to complete the
task.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the rest of the discussion the time unit is referred to as a
"tick" since the time scale for tasks is arbitrary.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="configurations-of-the-model">Configurations
of the Model</h3>
<p>Comparing different configurations of the model requires a metric.
Task throughput (number of tasks completed per unit time) is a way to
characterize the productivity of an organization.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this configuration, no coordination is required

configuration include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This configuration yields the maximum throughput tasks for the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding more people increases the throughput.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These same conclusions hold for any configuration of an organization
comprised exclusively of unicorns. The feasibility of gathering people
with relevant talents becomes challenging as the task complexity
increases or increased throughput is needed. That is part of why
organizations hire people who are not unicorns.</p>
<p>The distribution of skills and specializations of people in an
organization is set by the hiring process. Hiring less qualified people
is easier than finding highly skilled people. Other motives for hiring
non-unicorns include being able to pay non-unicorns less money,
non-unicorns are easier to find, and the possibility of on-the-job
training.</p>

<p>In this configuration, the person qualified as A1,B1 is labeled a
unicorn -- they can do any task. Whether you consider inclusion of A0,B0
(a person who does no work and can only coordinate) to be relevant
depends on your personal experience. Most organizations label these
members as "managers" because they are focused on task coordination.</p>
<p>When a person does not have all the specializations, then a task
randomly assigned to one person may need to be given to someone else in
the organization. For example, when a person qualified as A1 is given a
B1 task, that person needs to find a coworker who is either qualified as
B1 or A1,B1. Distributing tasks among members of the organization
requires coordination.</p>

are both unicorns and have similar task throughput. Person 4 does not
appear in this figure because they completed no tasks.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The need for coordination is due to the random initial delegation of
tasks not being aligned to the specializations and skill-levels of the
workers. Alignment of tasks with the skills people have could be made
systematic by introducing a person whose sole focus is assignment of
tasks. That person would be the manager.</p>
<div class="samepage">
<p>Conclusions from this configuration of the model:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The reward for good work is more work. People with more
specializations and more skills do more work than their
coworkers.</p></li>
<li><p>Time spent coordinating results in lower throughput of
tasks.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The last question for this configuration is how the throughput scales
as the number of people in the organization is increased. The overhead
of coordination among less-skilled people means that doubling the number
of participants does not double the task throughput. This observation
was made by <a

<img

style="width:70.0%" />
<figcaption>Task completion after 100 ticks versus number of people in
the organization. Dividing the values on the y-axis by 100 yields
throughput. 25 simulations were run for each organization size. Adding
people does increase throughput, but the variance of throughput
increases due to dependence on the distribution of specializations and
skill-levels of the participants. With 10 people the average task
throughput is between 5 and 6 tasks per tick even though each task takes
one tick. The suboptimal throughput is due to time spent coordinating
tasks. The instances where task completion is near zero occur when no
members of the organization have enough skills to address tasks. That
condition is less likely as the number of people increases.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When people in an organization are not unicorns (there are some tasks
a person is unable to do), then the task throughput is lower. If an
organization comprised of unicorns would operate faster, why distribute
work to people who lack the skills and rely on coordination? Because the
specialization of skills is too diverse for any one person to master
everything. This is easy to understand when the organization is society.
It would be faster for you to inspect the meat you eat for food safety,
monitor the emissions of the coal-fired power plant that powers your
house, build the semiconductor chips you use, and manufacture the
airplane you fly. However, you don't have all those skills and you want
the results quicker than you can complete the tasks yourself. Therefore,
the tasks are distributed among an organization of people with different
skills. The cost of coordination is that the throughput is lower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
When the number of people is held constant (e.g., 10), there is only 1
skill-level, the task duration is 1 tick, and the number of relevant
specializations is increased, then the task throughput is unchanged.
That may be surprising, but the cause is that the probability of a
person having a specific skill or not is 50%. As a consequence, the need
for coordinating a task is insensitive to the number of
specializations.</p>

<figcaption>Task completion after 100 ticks versus number of skill
levels. Dividing the values on the y-axis by 100 yields throughput. 50
simulations were run for each skill-level, with number of people held
constant at 10, task duration 1 tick, and number of specializations of
2. As the number of skill-levels is increased the task throughput
decreases due to more time spent finding a person with the necessary
skills. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:task-distribution-completed-vs-size"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:task-distribution-completed-vs-size">11.5</a> the
primary observation is that increasing the number of specialization
levels decreases task throughput. A separate trend is visible that
starts when there are a small number (2 or 3) skill levels for the 2
specializations. When none of the 10 people have one of the highest
skill-levels (in this configuration, A3 or B3) then a task requiring the
highest skill-level results in the person being unable to find someone
else to give the task to. When no person has the highest skill level
task completion is low because eventually everyone ends up with a task
they can't hand off to someone else. As the number of skill-levels is
increased, reaching the situation where no member can hand off a task
takes longer.</p>

class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Complexities Beyond the
Model</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="selection-of-tasks-is-complicated">Selection
of Tasks is Complicated</h3>
<p>An assumption in the model is that each person has a backlog of tasks
they work on sequentially. If that assumption is violated and the person
gets to choose their next task then negotiation and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making">decision-making</a>
are invoked. The outcome of a task may be unclear (great results,
mediocre results, or a dead-end), and the benefits of completing a task
may be informed by relationships with team members. A person in an
organization is informally bartering for attention of other members they
rely on. Prioritizing the backlog of tasks involves an implicit quid pro
quo with other people.</p>
<p>Having a backlog of tasks and not being constrained to serial
completion opens another question. Should you take a breadth-first
approach (do a little exploration of each) or a depth-first approach
(exhaust one option at a time before moving on to another)? The answer
depends on a few factors, like whether task switching is beneficial
(e.g., break in the monotony, or waiting for something else) or
detrimental (e.g., increased cognitive load, or decay of perishable
result).</p>
<h2 data-number="11.3" id="what-to-do-about-too-many-tasks"><span
class="header-section-number">11.3</span> What to Do about Too Many
Tasks</h2>
<p>Because unicorns can do any task, one way to improve throughput is to
invest in training people. Training in the context of this model has the
purpose of increased breadth (added specializations) or increased depth
(improved skill-level for a specialization). One reason there are not
more unicorns in an organization is that not everyone wants to know and
do everything. Knowing how to create a webpage, analyze data, manage a
server, initiate a contract, interact with customers, gather
requirements, and run a team can feel overwhelming. Another reason
unicorns are rare is turnover. When a person outgrows their assigned
role, they may look to other opportunities to feel more fulfilled.
Retaining unicorns is challenging.</p>
<p>A separate approach to having too many tasks relative to the number
of people in the workforce is to prioritize the work. Prioritization
doesn't necessarily increase task throughput, but without
prioritization, tasks get started and may not get completed. (The
problem of "start a task but don't finish it" isn't part of the
numerical model but does happen in real organizations.)</p>
<p>Prioritization requires sacrifice (what tasks are you not doing) and
induces risk (there are consequences to not doing tasks) and spends your
reputation (not doing tasks affects other people).</p>
<p>There are two different contexts for prioritization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The number of tasks is less than or equal to the amount of staff
attention available and skill. Then prioritization is merely ordering
the sequence of tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>When the number of tasks exceeds staffing capacity and
skill-level per person, an oversubscribed person won't get to every
task. Saying no is important but harms your reputation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Prioritization strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don't prioritize. Work on tasks as they are identified and don't
complete anything because it gets interrupted by the next task.</p></li>
<li><p>Static prioritization that is exclusive. Only work on one thing
to the exclusion of everything else.</p></li>
<li><p>Static prioritization by category. Likely to harm your reputation
with people come to you with tasks that aren't in your primary
category.</p></li>
<li><p>Shifting prioritization (prioritization changes over time);
either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritization evolves slower than tasks can be
completed.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritization shifts faster than tasks can be completed is
ineffective because it is indistinguishable from responding to tasks as
they arise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Prioritization within proportionally allocated task categories.
For example, suppose you have three categories of tasks. Allocate 10% of
your time to the first category, 20% of your time to the second, and
your remaining time to the third category.</p></li>
