<P>Writing the first edition of "Process Empathy" took 12 years. Primarily because I didn't start out with a plan to write a book.
Creating the content as blog entries was motivated by my intent to write down what I was observing as a experienced it. 
The time between my decision to convert blog content into a book and publish on Amazon KDP took 2.5 years. 

<P>Here's the sequence of events.
<OL>
<LI>Over the course of 10 years write 1000 blog posts on whatever topic I find interesting.</LI>
<LI>Realize that a recurring theme is bureaucracy.</LI>
<LI>Come up with a unifying definition of bureaucracy.</LI>
<LI>Cluster ~300 blog posts into subtopics. Use Latex's "book" documentclass.</LI>
<LI>Revise and make the transitions smoother.</LI>
<LI>Decide to self-publish rather than go with a traditional publisher.</LI>
<LI>Seek editors on FreeLancer. Input from one editor helps me understand how far away the current content is from a book.</LI>
<LI>Use Grammarly to catch spelling and grammar mistakes. Tried the "professional" (paid) version for a month but didn't get that much value.</LI>
<LI>Send content to readers to get feedback.</LI>
<LI>A reader's spouse offers to provided editing. This is very valuable.</LI>
<LI>Purchase ISBNs.</LI>
<LI>Publish using Amazon KDP.</LI>
